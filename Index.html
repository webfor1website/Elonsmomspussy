Preface
I wrote this with the hope that individuals experiencing Schizophrenic episodes, as well as their family members and friends, can recognize how these episodes can develop and make themselves apparent. Through my analysis, I’ve learned that many Schizophrenic episodes follow similar patterns, often triggered by excessive stress on the brain. Based on my own experience and understanding, it feels as though the brain fractures into two different parts, one conscious and one subconscious. The new subconscious part creates a complex puzzle through associations you make with auditory and visual cues that draw you in, compelling you to uncover more of the puzzle each day. The suspected causes and reasoning behind why my brain fracture occurred and how it revealed itself is drawn out inside the covers of this book. I’ve also written in detail about the way I uncovered the clues to the puzzles and the shocking beliefs that I had during this episode.  
The arrival of the “voices” in my head right at the time where my stress had reached its peak was uncanny and too coincidental to ignore. I refer to them as "voices" but, for me, they weren’t audible in the traditional sense. Instead, it felt more like an upload of information, teleported into my brain my telekinesis by an entity able to communicate directly within my brain. While these entities seemed to have accents and distinct ways of speaking, I think that they built those associations with people I knew from my life typically friends, enemies, even celebrities. This gave the voices camouflage, allowing them to blend in and exert even more influence over my thoughts.
They were extremely convincing continually stating that my survival and the survival of humanity was at state. This left me no choice but to believe them and damn were they convincing. It felt as though they were sent by an external force to help me solve the mysteries of the world.
In researching Schizophrenia further, I discovered that many others have reported similar experiences with voices starting to appear inside their head when they were stressed to their capacity. This has led many, including myself, to wonder whether these voices serve as some sort of intervention to stress, corrupting that section of the brain and breaking it off into a new entity. The consistency of these experiences among people with Schizophrenia seems too uniform to be purely coincidental. It seems highly unlikely to me that a break in the brain due to stress overload would produce such a similar pattern of delusional beliefs in so many isolated examples. Are we so much like computers that there can be corruption that creates the same patterns of belief so closely in so many different isolated examples? If so, that potentially opens a whole new world of possibilities in my opinion. 
The "voices" effectively created a new world for me full of new puzzles that I needed to keep waking up each day to solve to continue my pursuit of the conclusion of their guidance. The voices cautioned me not to reveal their messages or share anything about our "mission," threatening that I wouldn’t like the consequences if I did. Although they initially prevented me from succumbing to the relentless amount of stress I had, the pursuit of the puzzle they created for me cost me much more in the long run. 
The voices have relayed an interest in helping others with the disease to avoid the same pitfalls of delusion that I willingly stepped right into. I think that’s all we have to hold onto now. Perhaps they believed the delusions as much as I did, and we idiotically perpetuated each of our delusions back and forth (they’re saying that we did, but I don’t fucking believe them right now), deepening the entanglement. 
Here I sit with the assistance of their guidance recollecting the stories the best we can. I’m aware that most of my thoughts were simply delusions created by listening to the “voices,” but it seems there was something larger than just my brain at play. I’m compelled to believe that based on the similarities of patterns and similarities of themes between myself and others with the disease. Also, my creativity was never one of my strongest suits and the incredible journey that they took me on was unlike anything I could’ve come up with on my own. Frequently I presumed that I was a part of a Black Mirror episode because the themes were so intricate and borderline science fiction. 
It was as though my brain had been hijacked, and I became a passenger in my own life for several months. To be honest, that’s still how it feels to me, and perhaps it always will. There are some things that I did that I could never have imagined doing before they arrived. They frequently pushed me to the brink of doing extremely dangerous and potentially deadly things and then they would pull me back at the last second. Sometimes they were too late. Did I create that pattern of structure which they mimicked their behavior after through my own actions and the previous events of my life? 
In the end the way the voices structured their communication and puzzles in a way that led to a coherent conclusion to the puzzle. This also strikes me as strange because the individual stories and events could seem so disjointed at times that it was hard for me to believe they could come to such a concise conclusion. 
It continues to fascinate me how real and influential these voices were to me. When I first encountered them, they felt supernatural, as though they held an authority you cannot ignore. Let’s face it, when you’re overwhelmed by your current situation you want to believe something greater is real. They took the heed as that “something greater,” that kept me wanting to experience another day, one day at a time. But how would they know that’s what I needed? How could they have known when they needed to show up? How are they programmed to affect the same lost souls in the same type of search for greater meaning? 
The book is divided into two parts. Chapters One through Six cover the background and events leading up to my first Schizophrenic episode. The remaining chapters recount the actual stories, events, and experiences I lived through described as accurately as I can remember. In the beginning chapters there are anecdotes and themes of sexual deviancy which I believe contributed to my eventual breakdown. I apologize if any of these details are unsettling, but I felt it was important to provide the full context of everything I think contributed to my breakdown without shying away from details that embarrass me. I think this is important to the integrity of the story. 
It’s incredible how my brain operated under Schizophrenia. It created a web of associations, connecting songs, TV shows, movies, and even simple noises or notifications from my phone to form a pattern of beliefs. These associations were relayed to me by what I recognized as separate entities inside my mind. I genuinely believed these entities were external voices speaking to me from another dimension or realm. It felt as though they had logged into my brain or hacked my consciousness. They would ask me questions, give me directions, and set tasks that I could never have conceived of on my own, leading me to believe these thoughts weren’t originating from my own mind. At that time the only plausible explanation for me was that they were external.
I hope you find something valuable in this book, whatever your reason for reading it. I think it is an interesting and valuable story for everyone to delve further into the innerworkings of the mind, to fully embrace how dark and powerful the mind can be. I’m hoping that it might save your life or someone else’s life if you come across someone experiencing these types of delusions in the future.  
I felt compelled to share this story, believing it could be helpful for anyone affected by Schizophrenia. In my mind, if it helps even one person then it was all worth it. I might be lost to the cause, but I truly hope this changes someone’s life for the better or else I wouldn’t have spent all the time it took to write it. It’s been quite the journey. I’m still alive, and the voices are still with me most of the time.
This is my story…


“Jake this is going to blow up in your face in the worst way.  If I were you, I would dread every single phone call, every single email, every single weird look anyone shoots you.  If you want to play games with me, I’ll play games with you.  I love playing games, but only the ones I win of course.
I know your dad has a pretty high tolerance for you even though you’re an idiot, but he’s about to lose that last, hopeful little shred of respect he is clinging to.
What a shame.
Goddess Jessica”










Chapter 1 – Sexual Classical Conditioning
I’ve always had a sense that I was meant for something greater, even though I haven’t quite figured out what that was yet. I had always been a kind person ready to lend a hand to anyone, even strangers. I sometimes wondered if people had taken advantage of my generosity over the years, but when it was an attractive woman, I didn’t mind at all. I wasn’t cynical enough yet to build walls or guard my heart yet.
I stood 5’10” tall with deep brown eyes that drew people in, while my dark brown hair, usually styled into a purposefully messy, spiked look, gave off a carefree vibe. I went to the gym every day, maintaining a lean, ripped physique at 170 pounds, complete with defined abs and pecs. I didn’t focus much on leg day, but my frame was slender enough that not many noticed.
My personality was laid-back, with a sharp sense of humor. I never took life too seriously and was always ready with a joke or a smile. That was me—a mix of contradictions, charm, and unspoken desires, still searching for that elusive "something more.”
In high school, I was a bit awkward, so when it was time to start fresh after graduation, I headed to Arizona State University, eager to leave my past behind. I joined a fraternity at ASU, which introduced me to a tight-knit group of guys who became some of my closest friends. 
The campus was incredible, stretching about 1 mile by 1 mile in the middle of Tempe, Arizona. Mill Avenue extended directly off the campus and was about a ¾ mile strip of bars leading up to a mountain known as “A-Mountain,” because they put a giant golden “A” on it. My freshman year, before I even joined my fraternity, I was at a pre-rush party with some alumni from the frat I eventually pledged to. I got excessively drunk and told them I would paint the letter "A" red and black to match our fraternity colors to get into the frat. I barely remembered the conversation, but thankfully, they never made me follow through with it.
Fast forward to post-rush initiation, where we went room to room, taking shots with all of the active members of the fraternity. I ended up taking around seven shots in about an hour and was completely obliterated. I was slurring my words and stumbling, but they hoped I’d sober up on the way to the bar they had rented out, so they loaded me onto the bus anyway. I don't remember much, but apparently, I rested my head on the seat in front of me and vomited all over the floor of the bus. The guys quickly dragged me off the bus and hid me in a pitch-black party room, which had a stripper pole and a couch. I vaguely recall waking up disoriented in the darkness, struggling for about 20 minutes to find the door. When I finally got out, a couple of guys who stayed behind were hanging out in the house. Instead of heading to the bar with the others, I was content just drinking and smoking cigarettes with them on the frat house balcony.
I had this faint memory of falling down a flight of cement stairs later in the night, but I woke up fine besides a massive headache and a looming feeling of dread, lying in my own vomit on the floor of the balcony. I managed to trek back to my dorm, which was a five-minute walk to Palo Verde Main from the old frat row by the rail road tracks near Sun Devil Stadium.
Despite my drunken antics on our bid night, the fraternity still allowed me to pledge the fraternity – maybe they felt guilty that I had almost died. I was getting a weekly allowance of $120 from my loans, which my dad deposited into my checking account on Mondays. It was meant to last the week, but typically by Thursday, I’d be running low from spending most of it on beer and food. My grades were solid—three A’s and a B—so I figured I was doing fine just maybe partying a little too much. But in reality, I was a mess, getting way too drunk way too often. It wasn’t just about grades as most of my classes didn’t require attendance, so I’d just study a few hours before exams and still ace them. Brief Calculus was the only class I couldn’t pull that trick with, so I ended up dropping it when my last-minute study approach failed. I was just having too much “fun.”
During this early time at college, I met a girl named Cecily in my dorm. She was a gorgeous brunette with an olive complexion and dark brown eyes—a total sweetheart. She was high school friends with one of the guys pledging my fraternity, Josh, so we instantly had things to talk about. She also loved Dave Matthews Band, which is how we met. She was playing his music on her CD player, and I popped my head in to her dorm room and said, “Dave?” From there, we struck up a conversation. We began hanging out a lot, even kissed a few times, but I wasn’t sure if those kisses meant anything more.
One Saturday night, my fraternity threw a party at the frat house, and Cecily came with some of her sorority sisters. I was sitting with Cecily and another one of the girls from her sorority named Hanna, with my arms around both of them on either side of me. Hanna turned to me and said, “Well, you must feel like a pimp right now.” That was all the signal I needed. I leaned in and started making out with her. Cecily, understandably hurt, immediately left the party. I stayed behind with the other girl, Hanna.
Hanna was a stunning Asian girl from Oklahoma, with dark brown hair and eyes. She was built athletically, around 5’5” and 120 pounds, with a toned body from running cross country through high school. Things heated up quickly after Cecily left, and Hanna and I ended up lying down on the futon. I started fingering her and tried to take things further by removing her pants. I was ready to go all the way, but she whispered, “No sex.” I respected her boundary and instead kissed her again before going down on her. It was the furthest I’d ever been with a girl as hot as her, and I was completely lost in the moment.
Someone accidentally walked in on us and abruptly shut the door leaving us alone again, which startled Hanna, but instead of stopping, she leaned back in, even more determined. She straddled my face naked, pressing her pussy against my lips, and I eagerly continued, completely lost in the sensation. After about 15 minutes, I was drenched in her juices, and she climaxed. She gave me a quick blowjob and I was so turned on from going down on her that it didn’t take long for me to orgasm. 
The next day, I had to face Cecily. I played it off like I didn’t know what we were, which is why I went for Hanna and she gave me a second chance. She made it clear we were exclusive now, and I agreed. But less than a week later, I messed it up. I was drunk and horny and texted Hanna, asking if she wanted to come over. I guess I was selfish and looking for more action than Cecily was giving me. Hanna came over to my dorm, and just like before, she straddled my face and let me quench my submissive desire to bury my tongue in her pussy. We both ended up passing out in my bet but I couldn’t remember much other than her sitting on my face. When I awoke she was gone and my roommate gave me the glum news that Cecily already knew everything. That was the end of us.
Hanna and I hooked up a few more times after that. The last time, she told me she didn’t want to do anything to me but said I could go down on her if I wanted. I eagerly agreed. I quickly pulled her pants off and pulled her on top of me. She straddled my face, and I went to work for nearly 45 minutes until she climaxed, giving me nothing in return. She left after that, and while I would’ve gladly done it for the rest of my life, that was pretty much the end of our hookups. I still saw her around campus, and sometimes she'd study with a few guys in my fraternity, but that was the extent of us hanging out after her using my face as a dildo a few times early on in our freshman year. 
After an eight-week pledge program, I was initiated as an active brother. Our pledge class was huge—45 guys, larger than the entire active fraternity at the time. It was a great group, and there was always something going on. We’d hang out at the house every night we weren’t heading out to support our fraternity sports teams or participating in date parties, socials, or participating in philanthropies. At the house we found plenty of things to do and it was like a party existed every night there. The big parties we put on there were legendary. We had the biggest Christmas party on campus, and one of the brothers built a 14-foot reindeer covered in Christmas lights that you could see all the way from my dorm. The night of the Christmas party there must’ve been 500 people there. The halls were packed shoulder to shoulder with brothers in the fraternity, a few select guests, and an insane amount of girls. 
Around the time of the Christmas party we had started hanging out a lot with another sorority often. They had assigned girls to our fraternity to coach us for their philanthropy. Philanthropies were events put on by the sororities that multiple fraternities participated in to try to win a trophy declaring them as the winners. There were often a few large events like football, tug of war, or other athletic events. They always threw in a couple additional less objective events so they could manipulate the standings a bit at the end of they needed to. They typically had one or two fraternities in their philanthropies that they had great relations with and wanted to have them place in the top three.  These more objective events usually consisted of things like lip syncing or a performance of some kind. Two of the girls that I met from the sorority became a couple of my good friends for the rest of college. Their names were Stephanie and Laura. They were best friends, and Stephanie was a gorgeous 5’3” Asian with a great body, tan skin, a confident, sexy voice, beautiful dimples and the cutest smile. Laura was pretty as well, but not as stunning as Stephanie. She was about the same height with brown hair and eyes, with pale skin, and a very slender build.
I had a crush on Stephanie, but she was pursued by most everyone in our fraternity as well as other guys throughout the campus. She was one of the hottest girls in her sorority and at ASU for sure. I was friend zoned from the beginning, but at the time, I was too inexperienced to recognize it. That didn't stop me from pursuing her like a devoted puppy for four years.
It was as if there existed an unspoken rule in her relationships: any guy she dated had to accept our friendship. I had even made a few attempts to persuade her to explore a more dominant dynamic between us but she declined my attempts to convince her to use me. I always found myself at her beck and call anyways. Particularly on those bleary Tuesday and Friday mornings our Junior year at 8:15 AM, when she’d swing by my apartment, park her car, and awaken me from my sleep to drive her to her early class. She didn’t seem to have an issue taking advantage of my crush on her when it suited her well. On especially stormy days, I’d even brave the elements to pick her up afterward if I happened to be awake.
One rainy day stands out in vivid detail: she called me, drenched and asking for a ride back to her car. When I arrived, I couldn’t pull all the way up because there was a gate blocking the road. In just the 25 yards she needed to walk to my car she was soaked to the bone, her hair clinging to her delicate features. Instinctively, I draped my jacket over her sexy tanned legs, feeling a longing swirl within me.
Another morning, after a night spent with a guy, she called me for a ride home. I was hungover myself and let her know I wasn’t really up to it, somewhat fearing that was a slippery slope of allowing her to continually take advantage of me but only on her terms. She must’ve gotten the feeling that maybe the request was too manipulative because she ultimately found another way. I was always willing to do anything for her, willing to drop everything at a moment’s notice.
There was also a day our junior year when I was still crushing on her when she was dating a guy from another fraternity, and she was going on vacation with him. She invited me over to her condo while she packed, and then had me help her pick out lingerie for her to wear with him on vacation. In that moment, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was subtly trying to dominate me, enjoying her power while leaving me weaker and more vulnerable to her intoxicating charms.
Finally, one night, emboldened by a few too many drinks, I mustered the courage to ask if I could pay her to financially dominate me. She quickly shot me down, saying she wasn't comfortable with it. I suspected she preferred to be the one composing the power dynamic. Not wanting to ruin our friendship, I steered away from asking her about it again, and we remained friends. 
After my freshman year we lost our Fraternity house. Michael Crow, the President at ASU, had an agenda of claiming imminent domain on the frat houses near the football stadium and we were the first house crossed off his list. College was still fun after that and the fraternity survived without moving into the ASU Fraternity housing offered, which was just like another dorm. We all moved into different apartments throughout the area and would alternate locations for smaller parties. By this time, I had made my closest friends in the fraternity, and we separated into a niche group who would hang out the most often. We would still frequently get together for our sporting events, and other social events, so it wasn’t like losing the house destroyed all the relationships, but it did make it a little more difficult for everyone to get together as much. 
In 2007, I had a fling with a girl named Laura from Stephanie’s sorority who was dating a guy from a rival fraternity. She had a cute charm that caught my attention over time. We’d been flirting for a while, frequently sexting about all kinds of dirty things—she had a crush on me, and I wasn’t about to turn down the opportunity to hook up with her. One rainy day, she asked if I wanted to watch some movies at my apartment. We had hung out a lot in groups before, but never on a one on one basis, so I figured she wanted to more than just watch movies. She came over to my apartment and we walked up the road to blockbuster.  
My heart raced as we wandered the aisles of the video rental store. I couldn’t stop thinking about massaging her sexy feet and feeling submissive to her. After some consideration, she picked out Cruel Intentions and The Island, and we headed back to my apartment. It was perfect—my roommate wasn’t home, so we had the place to ourselves. She stretched out on the couch, casually resting her feet in my lap with her sexy feet right in front of my face. I couldn’t help but admire how beautiful they were.
After what felt like an eternity, I finally worked up the courage to ask if she wanted a foot massage. She grinned and said, “sure if you want to give me one,” and I start massaging them. My mind raced with forbidden thoughts—I wanted to suck on her toes, to feel like her little foot slave. As we sat there, I slowly leaned forward, laying down with her feet resting on my chest, and as I massaged them, I kissed her toes. They were sweaty, but I didn’t care—I was in Heaven.
With a surge of adrenaline, I closed my eyes and started sucking on her toes, my heart pounding in my chest. As I massaged and sucked on one foot, I began fingering her through the pajama pants she’d worn, and she responded by pressing her other foot into my face. The sensation overwhelmed me. We eventually switched feet, and I continued, feeling utterly humiliated yet wildly turned on by the fact that I was worshipping this girl’s sweaty, dirty feet. It was intoxicating.
At some point, she asked if I wanted to take things to the bedroom. She made it clear that she wanted me to go down on her but didn’t want to do anything to me because she had a boyfriend. I guess that felt less like cheating in her mind. Without hesitation, I led her to my room, where she laid back on the bed, and I lowered my face to her pussy. The thought of her potentially fucking her boyfriend recently consumed me, turning me on even more. The idea that I was eating her out after she’d probably just fucked him felt like the ultimate act of submission. She grabbed my head and pushed my face deeper into her until she finally came.
Afterward, we went back to the couch and about five minutes later, the front door swung open, and her boyfriend walked in. I guess we should’ve remembered to lock the door, although maybe that would’ve been suspicious too. My heart nearly stopped, but we weren’t fooling around anymore at that point, so he didn’t catch us. They left together shortly after, and even though I hadn’t gotten any physical satisfaction from the encounter, the memory of being treated like her submissive was more than enough to get me off later.
Shortly after that she and her boyfriend broke up because he found out she cheated on him with me. I’m sure she spun the story, probably told him that she didn’t do anything, that I did it all to her. And to be honest, that was mostly true. But she loved every second of it, just as much as I did. The rest of college was a blur of parties and random hookups. 
Another girlfriend I briefly dated in college was named Briana. She was a fiery 5'4" beauty, with striking brown hair and captivating brown eyes. Her flawless tan skin complemented her incredible figure, and she possessed large, perfectly shaped breasts that added to her draw. Briana had a presence that was hard to ignore, exuding both confidence and charm, making her someone who effortlessly turned heads wherever she went. I had a crush on her long before she even knew I existed. We shared a Calculus class my freshman year, and I always thought she was the hottest girl in the room. She was from Jersey so she had one of those nails on chalkboard accents, but for some reason I found it hot on her. She was direct and almost demanding which I found sexy. 
It wasn’t until we were introduced by a mutual friend, Dave, one of my fraternity brothers, that I finally got a chance to talk to her. We started hanging out at parties, and eventually, at the beginning of 2008, we kissed for the first time at my apartment.
A couple of weeks into dating, we had fooled around but hadn’t had sex yet when Briana went on a previously scheduled trip to Rocky Pointe, Mexico, without me. When she and my friends returned they let me know she had cheated on me while I was there. Oddly enough, I wasn’t too heartbroken, but she started questioning if we should break up. I didn’t want to look like a fool for wanting to continue dating her after her cheating on me and not knowing if she wanted to, so I told her if she had any doubts, we should just end things. We decided to stay friends, but things got messy from there.
One night, we were hanging out with one of her guy friends, watching a movie in her living room. I was supposed to take her to a concert in Tucson the next day, but that night, after I pretended to fall asleep on the couch, she took her friend to her bedroom. I stayed awake, listening to them have sex just 10 feet away, and I walked out of the apartment and slammed the door hurt that she didn’t respect me enough to wait until I wasn’t around to hook up with a guy when she knew I still liked her. 
The next day, I confronted her about it, but she denied everything. We still went to the Taking Back Sunday concert in Tucson, and even after all that, I couldn’t shake my feelings for her. I kept trying to pursue her, despite her cheating on me.
After classes a few days later, I went over to her place to hang out and watch tv. We were sitting on the couch, and I couldn’t stop staring at her feet—her tan feet with French-tipped toes looked so sexy. I offered her a foot massage, and she stretched out her legs, wearing tiny mesh shorts and a t-shirt. I started massaging her feet, hoping it would lead to something more. As I moved my hands slowly up her legs, trying to get closer to her pussy, she stopped me, saying it was just a massage. I awkwardly went back to rubbing her feet. Then, we heard the door slam in the kitchen. One of her roommates had come home. I wasn’t sure whether I should stop massaging her feet out of embarrassment or keep going like nothing was out of the ordinary. I decided to just keep going, though I probably looked like a whipped puppy.
I was still trying everything I could to win her back, paying for dinners, taking her out, anything. One hot summer day, we worked at her cousin’s wedding—her cousin was a florist, and we were helping to set things up. Briana, always playful, sat on top of a cart while I pushed her around, taking her wherever she wanted to go. We passed an older man who was setting up at the wedding, and she turned to me, laughing, “He probably thinks you’re my little bitch, pushing me around.” Despite the sting of her words, I continued hanging out with her, still hoping I could somehow win her over again.
After a few months of following Briana around like a devoted servant my luck finally began to turn one night when I was out at the bars on Mill Avenue. I ran into Lauren, a girl I had seen around the fraternity a few times. She had a twin sister named Andrea, and both of them were stunning—about 5’7” with brown hair, with great bodies, beautiful brown eyes, and big, bright smiles. Lauren had a slight lazy eye, but to me, she was the more classically beautiful of the two.
That night, Lauren had just turned 21, and we immediately hit it off. I turned on the charm, making her and her friends laugh all night long. By the end of the night, we exchanged numbers, and soon enough, we were hanging out regularly. Within a few weeks, we were officially dating, and I genuinely thought I had met the girl I was going to marry.
Through Lauren, I met a whole new circle of friends that she had known from high school—people like Tim, Dan, Brad, Chris, Mike (two of them, actually), Patrick, Travis, and their girlfriends. We spent most weekends drinking at house parties or heading out to the bars on Mill Avenue. Typically, when heading out to the bars we’d go to our favorite spot, Cue Club.
Everything with Lauren started off so well it felt almost like a dream. Within the first year, we were already imagining our future together and discussing potential names for our kids. However, we did come from very different backgrounds. My family had always been relatively stable, with my parents having enough money to provide for everything we needed and not getting into fights very often. Lauren's family, on the other hand, struggled. Her mother had a gambling addiction, which made things even harder for them and her parents fought all the time always seemingly on the edge of a divorce.
It felt like I was able to bring some much-needed stability into Lauren's life, especially during that period when she seemed to need it most. Our time together was filled a lot of fun, laughter, and adventure. Dating during my senior year was a blast, and even after I graduated in 2009, we continued to have so much fun together. The connection we shared felt deep and full of promise.
Cue Club was legendary, not just for the drinks, but for the crowd it drew. It was a pool hall located right in the middle of Mill Avenue, which was the main bar street at ASU.  The hottest girls from ASU either worked there or regularly drank there. Usually, all three of our favorite bartenders would be working too. Lindsey, the tall, slender blonde, always kept things fun and had a witty sense of humor and coy smile. Then there was Amelie, standing at 5’5”, with a striking figure and a face so stunning she could’ve passed for a famous porn star. And finally, there was Sam who was the queen of the place. At 5’2”, she was tiny but confident, she had this killer smile that lit up the whole bar. She knew how gorgeous she was, and I could only imagine how often she got hit on every weekend. I always thought she was incredibly hot, but she was way out of my league, and besides, I was dating Lauren.
Those weekends at Cue Club were some of the best times of my life—wild nights, unforgettable friendships, and the excitement at being surrounded by the hottest girls from ASU.
I usually blended in well in most environments, but whenever I drank too much, my inhibitions crumbled, and my sexual urges surged. I vividly remember multiple occasions even after starting to date Lauren where I would spot an attractive girl at the bar, feeling overwhelmed with lust, and rushing to hail a cab just to race home and indulge in deviant porn. My obsession with female domination had been with me for as long as I could remember.  
After a night of drinking my senior year of college, my roommate Josh came back from the bars to find me passed out with my hand down my pants and my laptop still open. I’d been trying to get off to some hardcore femdom porn, and there it was, displayed for him to see. He was cool about it and didn’t judge me but there was some teasing me about being into weird shit like that. 
My tastes were wide-ranging and intense. I was into everything: face-sitting, pegging, enforced chastity, toe-sucking, foot worship, humiliation, cuckolding, and even financial domination. These fantasies would spill over into my real life. I’d imagine the hot girls I knew or the ones I saw at bars doing these things to me. The idea of being controlled, used, and humiliated by beautiful women had a hold on me. 
Chapter 2 – “Professional” “Life”
In 2009, I graduated right into the middle of one of the worst recessions the United States had seen since the early '80s, armed with a degree in Business Marketing that suddenly felt useless. The job market was horrible, especially for someone looking for marketing positions—no one was hiring. It was brutal.
With few options, I ended up taking my first job as a recruiter for a staffing company, pulling in a meager $32,000 a year. It was a far cry from the career I had imagined after four years of college at Arizona State University, earning a business degree. It felt like life had dealt me a shitty financial hand, and felt the returning feeling of impending doom. “Is this what the rest of my life will be like?” Nope, it got worse. 
My boss in my first job out of college was an absolute dictator. It was a staffing company and our office was 1,000 miles away from the next closest branch, which gave him the autonomy he wanted to manage with as much pressure as he felt like. It was suffocating, the hours were brutal, and the positions we were trying to fill were so specialized that finding qualified candidates was like searching for a needle in a haystack. One day, after over a year of working there and always grading towards the middle to top quarter of recruiters in the company, I came into the office and he told me to take the day off to "think about how I could improve." No warning, no conversation—just a day off without pay. It was insane behavior, and I couldn’t believe he was getting away with it.
Financially, I was barely scraping by. My salary and commissions were just enough to keep me afloat, but not enough to enjoy life the way I had hoped after graduation. It was frustrating—living paycheck to paycheck, trying to support both myself and Lauren, all while feeling like my potential was being wasted.
I managed to stick it out with the staffing company until 2011, but I felt like I needed a change. One day, Lauren and I met up with our friend Mike J who I had met through her.  He and some other friends were eating at a restaurant in Tempe for dinner and to have a couple of drinks.  He was speaking about interviewing with a large global logistics company for an inside sales position. The idea intrigued me. It sounded like a much better career path than the dead-end job I was stuck in at the time. The role was part of an accelerated inside sales program that was designed to promote employees into field roles within two years or less. The thought of fast-tracking to an outside sales position, where I’d get a higher base salary and a shot at serious commission, was too tempting to pass up. I applied, was scheduled for an interview, and had the job within a week. My luck seemed to be turning.
The new company was a welcome change from the three-man office I was in at the staffing company. It was a inside sales force about 60 people strong, and we also housed a lot of the national operational teams and our leads department. Most of the employees were younger fresh out of college, so we’d all frequently meet up for happy hours and go out with each other on the weekends. It was a lot of fun, but the salary and commission of the inside sales role were wearing on me and wearing on my and my relationship with Lauren. I just wasn’t making enough money still to support both of our nights out all of the time in addition to all of our other expenses. I was always just barely scraping by. 
By the end of 2012, I got the news I had been waiting for: I was being considered for a promotion to a field sales role, with the options being either Houston or Philadelphia. My first stop was Houston, but I wasn’t exactly impressed. The parts of the city I saw were rough, and to top it off, the hotel I stayed in had had a murder there just the week before. The one bright spot of the trip was catching up with Laura from ASU. She had moved out there to study for her Masters in Psychology.
Things between Lauren and I had become a bit shaky. After years of her schooling and the distance it created, we weren’t even officially dating anymore. To me it kind of felt like she just used me as a financial crutch for awhile while she finished her nursing school. I texted Laura and asked if she wanted to meet me at the hotel or head out to a bar. Her apartment was nearby so she said she wanted to and agreed to swing by the hotel first. By the time she arrived at around 8:00 p.m., I was already six Blue Moons deep—drinks courtesy of the company. They had told me to have a good time, and I took full advantage of it.
We didn’t have much time to stay out, so after a quick beer at the hotel, we hit the town, ending up at a cowboy bar complete with punch machines, pool tables, and flirty servers. As the night went on, I decided to bring up something I had mentioned to Laura in passing before—that I had a thing for financial domination. She was studying to become a Doctor of Psychology after ASU in Houston, aiming to be a therapist, and I think she found my kink… intriguing.
Financial domination was a newer fetish at the time which consisted of a submissive man giving a woman money as a power exchange. Usually he would give her money to humiliate him or tease him about her superiority and dominance over him. It gave me a stir of humiliation to be used in that way, and to submit to gorgeous women in that fashion. 
I decided to take a chance and bent down to slip a twenty-dollar bill into her cowboy boot. She looked at me with a curious smile. “Oh, so you really do like this, huh?” she teased, referring to the financial domination I had mentioned.
“Yeah, I do,” I admitted with a grin. She smiled back, clearly enjoying the exchange of power. There was something sexy about it—the way she held that control, even in something as small as a twenty slipped into her boot. It was a brief moment, but it stayed with me, that quiet understanding between us.
We ended up staying out far too late, caught up in the fun of the night. Laura had met some guy she seemed into, but around midnight, I knew I had early interviews looming the next morning. We headed back to the hotel, and I asked if she wanted to stay over with me. She agreed but quickly added, “I can’t have sex or anything—I’m on my period.” I wasn’t too fazed by that and figured maybe I could still get something out of the situation, so I told her it was fine, and we stumbled back into my hotel room.
As soon as she kicked off her cowboy boots, my eyes were drawn to her feet. I casually asked if she wanted me to massage them, and she shrugged, saying, “Sure.” She was still wearing her socks, damp from sweating in the boots and the extra humidity from the rain that night. As I rubbed her feet, I started moving them closer to my face. She was just relaxing, completely oblivious to how turned on I was.
I shifted my position, lying on my back so that her feet rested on my chest, just inches from my face. Slowly, I began sliding her socks off, and she flexed her legs slightly, helping them slip free. Now her sweaty, bare feet were right in front of me. The scent of them—musky and warm—filled the air. I grabbed her left foot, continuing to massage it, then slipped her toes into my mouth. I started sucking, running my tongue along each toe. She didn’t pull away—in fact, she pushed her toes deeper into my mouth, like she was making me suck them now.
She chuckled, making some teasing remark about how much I enjoyed her feet, but I was too lost in the moment to care. I kept going, moving from her toes to the balls of her feet, licking up and down the soles, cleaning them with my tongue like her little toy. The salty taste mixed with the soft humiliation of the whole situation—it drove me wild. The fact that I had paid her $20 earlier and was now worshipping her feet while she barely paid me any attention made me hornier than ever.
Desperate for more, I pleaded with her to let me eat her pussy. She reminded me, almost dismissively, that she was on her period, but I didn’t care—I was too deep in my submissive haze to think rationally. Despite my begging, she refused, uninterested in taking things any further. She was relishing the control, savoring how I was completely at her mercy without expecting anything in return. And honestly, I was too caught up in it to stop.
I continued sucking on her toes, each one slick with my saliva as I worshipped her feet like a man possessed. The mixture of her indifference and the sheer eroticism of the situation had me hooked. Eventually, exhaustion overtook me, and I passed out, her feet still in my mouth.
A few hours later, I woke up to the blaring of my alarm. Groggy and disoriented, I realized her feet were still resting on my chest, inches from my face. The memory and humiliation of sucking and worshipping her feet all night came rushing back. I was a bit embarrassed that I had worshipped her so submissively without getting anything in return. I let her know I had to get ready for my interviews but told her she could stay and sleep in until 10:00 a.m. as long as she checked out of the room by 11:00. She gave a lazy nod, still half-asleep, and said that wouldn’t be a problem. I had to masturbate in the bathroom before heading to my interviews still so red with humiliation and turned-on by it as well. I was associating my orgasms with the rush of humiliation and it had taken my orgasms when masturbating to new heights. I was hooked on the feeling.
After the interviews that day, I let my director, Raul, know I was open to relocating to Houston for the higher pay and the opportunity to work in an outside sales role. However, he insisted I also visit Philadelphia before making a final decision. I agreed to check it out so, I flew to Philly and was greeted at the airport by a stunning sales representative named Lauren. She was tall, with a sultry East Coast accent that drew me in right away. I spent the day shadowing her as she made rounds to high-profile clients in the towering skyscrapers of Center City.
Lauren was impressive—sharp, efficient, and meticulous in her meetings. She even found a large new opportunity with a major motorcycle parts company, and watching her work, I couldn’t help but develop a bit of a crush. Beyond her beauty, her professional poise made me realize she’d be the perfect mentor, someone who could really help me grow into a top-tier sales rep. My potential territory would be just outside the heart of the city, but from what I saw, Philadelphia had a lot to offer.
After finishing our day together, I called Raul to let him know that I preferred Philadelphia over Houston. He said that he would prefer me there because he would be taking a position as the director of that sales territory, and my direct manager would be a budding superstar salesman out of New York City, who had regularly led the company in sales numbers. My role would essentially involve finding new opportunities and then bringing in my new manager, Rejesh, to seal the deals with decision-makers. I felt confident that finding new business would be a breeze, and I was eager for the challenge that lay ahead. With a bit of luck, I could flourish in my new sales role in the greater Philadelphia area and quickly climb the ladder to a National Account Manager position.
Raul told me to go out and get a feel for the rest of the city that night so I took a cab downtown after I got off the phone with him and rested for a couple of hours. My first stop was a quirky bar with dartboards and graffiti-covered walls called Dirty Franks. I ordered a pint of local IPA, enjoying the laid-back vibe before heading to my next destination—an Irish pub called Jimmy’s, just around the corner. As I walked in, I spotted a group of four men, probably ranging from their late 30s to mid-50s, laughing and joking around the bar. One of them, an older man from New Jersey, was playfully being teased as a mobster, with his friends joking that anyone who crossed him might just disappear.
They seemed like a fun bunch, so I offered to buy them a round of shots. But they waved me off, explaining they were celebrating a wedding and insisted on treating me instead. I joined them in their celebrations, and before long, I was several shots of Tullamore Dew and a couple of Guinness deep. We laughed, drank, and partied well into the night, and by the time it was over, I had completely fallen in love with the Philadelphia nightlife. The last thing I remember was raising a glass with them before everything went black.
I woke the next morning to my alarm blaring at 8:55 a.m. in a haze of confusion. My flight was at 10:15 a.m., and I was cutting it way too close. Still half-dazed, I rushed to pack and barely made it to the airport in time to catch my flight back to Arizona.
My director, Raul, informed me that Rejesh wanted to meet for an interview before finalizing my hiring, and if all went smoothly, I would soon be packing my bags, receiving a generous relocation allowance of $7,500, and embarking on an exciting new chapter in Philadelphia. 
They wanted to move quickly, so I would be flying out to Philadelphia just two days later. Rejesh would pick me up from the airport and take me back to the office, where we would conduct interviews throughout the day. To make the most of my visit, Raul decided I should shadow a coworker named Eric whom I had worked with on the inside sales team.  He was now in Baltimore doing sales within the same area and under the same manager as I would have. Raul thought that might give me a deeper insight into the East Coast operations and team dynamics and also help through making some additional connections.
Everything seemed to click during my interview with Rejesh, and I thoroughly enjoyed shadowing Eric the following day. After the workday ended, Eric, his girlfriend Jamie, and I went out with some of the Baltimore team for dinner and drinks. We hit several bars, laughing and bonding over shared stories, and I felt an instant camaraderie with everyone. I really liked the team, and my new manager, Rejesh, seemed like a good guy. Plus, with Eric and Jamie in Baltimore, I knew I would have friends nearby to visit in Baltimore—or they could come see me in Philadelphia. The future was shaping up to be quite exciting and I was ready for a bit of a change and to see what the next chapter of my life might hold.
When I returned to Phoenix, I quickly fired off an email to Raul, expressing my desire to accept the Philadelphia position if it was offered to me. To my excitement, he responded within the hour, informing me that my new salary would be $53,000, and they wanted me to relocate within two weeks. My last day at the Tempe office would be that Friday, giving me two full weeks to pack up my life and settle into Philadelphia. I would start my new role the Monday after the second weekend, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter.
Rajesh tried to convince me to ship my car, stating that it would significantly speed up my transition and allow me to start sooner. But I was determined to drive out myself, craving the chance to explore along the way and savor the two weeks off from the daily grind of work. “Everyone else has taken advantage of their time off to move, so why shouldn’t I?” I reasoned, excited at the prospect of a little adventure.
Plus, driving would allow me to save a chunk of my $7,500 relocation bonus for essentials like rent, bedroom furnishings, and a little bit of fun once I got settled in. The thought of hitting the open road, soaking in the sights, and embarking on this new journey fueled my excitement even further.
I was popular both at the office and among my college friends in Tempe, so they decided to throw me a going-away party before my big move to Philadelphia. We settled on Cue Club, the pool hall bar in Tempe, and everyone came out to send me off in style. Our favorite bartenders, Samantha and Lindsey—both absolute stunners from ASU—were serving us that night, which made the evening even better. I felt pretty loved.
My friend Ash showed up, and since he wasn’t working at the time, he offered to help with the drive from Phoenix to Philly if I covered his flight back home. I thought it was a great idea. Having him along to split the driving shifts would help us make better time and also have someone to talk to on the cross-country trip sounded great.
That night in Tempe was unforgettable—full of laughter, goodbyes, and a sense of excitement for the next chapter of my life.
Towards the end of the night Lauren and I decided to get a hotel room in Tempe for one last romantic night together. We started making out as soon as we entered the room, and I pressed her up against the wall. Unfortunately, I had drank too much and couldn't get hard. Determined to please her, I went down on her with her lying on her back and after a few minutes she teasingly asked, "Do you want me to sit on your face?" Her sitting on my face had become a ritual in our relationship. I think that she enjoyed feeling dominant over her boyfriend, and of course I loved feeling sexually submissive to her with her pussy pressing down on my lips while she stared down at me. That was probably the main issue with our relationship. She gained too much power and relished the way she could manipulate me to do whatever she wanted.
"Yes, baby," I replied, and she straddled my stomach, slowly working her way up until her juicy pussy met my lips. I grabbed her hips, pulling her closer, loving the sensation of tasting her. That always got me going. In that position, my arousal quickly returned. Sometimes she'd even pin my hands down with her knees, teasing me until she was fully satisfied. It was her way of taking control, and it never failed to drive me wild. After a few minutes of her riding my face, I was rock hard again. She shifted and began riding my dick, but the experience wasn’t quite the same. Sex with her had gotten a bit boring, and I almost preferred being pinned down beneath her, lost in the fantasy that had become a part of our sex life.
In the beginning, simple missionary was enough to make things feel electric, but by now, my mind had wandered into kinkier fantasies. Only then could I finish, feeding off that twisted mix of desire and submission.
We still weren’t together and the night was classified more as a hook-up than a rekindling. I was already excited about the move to Philadelphia—ready to explore new opportunities and meet other women. Finally, I felt like I was escaping the rut I had been stuck in for so long.
A couple of days after the farewell party, I loaded up my trusty Prius with my most essential belongings, ready to embark on a new adventure. As I hugged my parents goodbye, they presented me with a heartfelt card featuring the words "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" to celebrate this exciting new chapter in my life. Inside, they had penned touching messages, filled with encouragement and well wishes for my journey ahead.
Having moved to Sun City, Arizona, after retiring two years ago, my parents had settled into a quieter lifestyle to be closer to me post-college. My mom, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2009, faced significant challenges in getting around and was often in pain. Despite this, she and my dad, Josh, seemed content as homebodies in their sunny oasis. At 56 and 59 years old, respectively, it felt fitting for them to embrace a slower pace of life. They appeared to enjoy their serene existence, supported by my mom’s disability income and my dad's retirement savings. With their house bought outright by my grandmother, they seemed set for the future, living comfortably without financial stress.
The night before my departure for Philadelphia, I went to Tempe for one last bittersweet goodbye with Lauren. I enveloped her in a warm hug, kissing her with a mix of love and lingering uncertainty. While I was still deeply attached, having invested so much time, money, and emotion into our connection, it seemed like she was drifting away. The intimacy of our farewell made saying goodbye even more challenging. We eventually parted ways, both of us aware that this moment marked a significant turning point.
The next morning I loaded up the car and set off to pick up Ash from his apartment in Tempe, eager to kick off our journey to Philadelphia. Our adventure had a lively itinerary: a visit to Austin to see my friend Stephanie from Laura’s sorority in college, a leisurely two-day stop in Nashville, and possibly another major East Coast city before making our way up the coast to Philly.
After about 14 hours on the road, we finally arrived at Stephanie’s apartment in Austin. She still looked stunning—with the same infectious smile and a soothing voice that could charm anyone. We went out with some of her friends in downtown Austin for a few drinks, effortlessly slipping back into our rhythm as we caught up and shared laughter throughout the night. She was the kind of friend you could reconnect with seamlessly, skipping past any awkwardness as if no time had passed at all.
The next morning, Ash and I set off for Nashville, a city we had both been eagerly anticipating. The drive from Austin to Nashville stretched over thirteen hours, with the threat of snowfall looming on the horizon. We took turns behind the wheel in two-and-a-half-hour increments, each of us buzzing with excitement for the adventure ahead. We rolled into Nashville late, around 10:00 PM, yet adrenaline still coursed through our veins. As we navigated through the city, passing the vibrant bars that lined the streets, we could feel the energy rising around us. The lively nightlife summoned us, promising a night of unforgettable fun.
Ash was particularly excited about the live music scene; he had played guitar his entire life and had become quite skilled. Back in junior high, after being grounded for an entire summer, he had been given only one privilege: to play his guitar. That enforced isolation turned out to be a fast track to mastery, and he had developed the talent of a seasoned lead guitarist, fit for any band. Ash was contemplating a move to Nashville, depending on how our trip went.
We hopped into a cab from our hotel and headed straight for Broadway, enthusiastic to dive into the live music and soak in the atmosphere. For those who don’t know, Nashville is known as the Bachelorette Party capital of the United States, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. The main strip was packed with gorgeous women in cowboy boots, though being winter, many opted for pearl snap shirts and jeans instead of cut off shorts like all the songs. Damn, they were stunning. I couldn’t help but think it was even better than Scottsdale. It felt like a mini-Vegas, minus the gambling, with live music spilling from every corner. “This is the best party city I’ve ever been to, aside from maybe Las Vegas,” Ash declared, and I agreed.
After our exciting first night, we decided to dive into round two and extend our hotel stay for another night. Ash was eager to explore more bars, seeking potential venues where he could showcase his talent if he chose to make Nashville his new home. Meanwhile, I was simply excited to keep the party going. We allowed ourselves a leisurely morning; the trip and long drive had finally caught up with us. Night two was a lot of fun too, but by then, Ash was starting to feel a bit worn out from my partying.
The following morning, we hit the road early, determined to reach Philadelphia by nightfall. This would give us Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to enjoy the city before Ash's flight home on Sunday night. 
As I began the drive toward Philadelphia, the radio warned of potential snowstorms in eastern Tennessee and up through the Baltimore/Washington D.C. area. We checked the radar and it looked like we would be driving straight into it for at least a couple of hours. We met the edge of the snowfall near Knoxville, but managed to push through, maintaining our momentum.
As we approached Richmond, we encountered yet another wave of snow, this time thick and heavy, significantly slowing down traffic and hindering our progress. By the time we finally navigated through the city, it was already past 8:00 PM, and we were crawling along the highway at a sluggish 20-25 mph. Exhausted from the relentless traffic and the long drive, we pressed onward toward Washington D.C. The snow swirled around us like a scene from a movie. Turning to Ash, I asked, “Do you want to just stay in D.C. for the night and drive the rest of the way up tomorrow?” He nodded in agreement, and I quickly pulled up Orbitz to find a budget-friendly hotel near the busy part of D.C. We finally arrived at the hotel around 10:45 PM. Ash was exhausted and opted to hit the hay right away, while I couldn’t resist heading out to a bar to check out the girls and have a couple drinks before I went to sleep. 
The following morning, we woke up to a melting landscape, the snow having vanished overnight. We hit the road around 1:30 PM, but the remains of the snowfall made for shaky driving conditions. It wasn’t until just after 7:00 PM that we finally arrived in Philadelphia. A guy named Bill answered the door—a friendly figure standing about 5'11" with blue eyes and sandy blonde hair cut in a neat crew cut. He had a kind face, though his slightly heavyset frame suggested he enjoyed a good meal.
Within moments, the other two roommates, Alex and Ian, shuffled into the room. “Good to meet you all! I can grab some beers if anyone is in the mood,” I offered. An awkward silence fell over them as they exchanged glances, trying to find the right words to deliver some disappointing news. Finally, Ian broke the silence, “Well, actually, here in Philadelphia, you can’t buy beer right now. It’s Sunday, and they only sell it at dispensaries, which are already closed for the day. So, if you want to drink, you will need to hit up a bar.”
My face must have shown some of my disappointment, but I quickly covered it up, suggesting we check out a nearby bar. With a sense of adventure still buzzing through me—I didn’t have to work for another week—I whipped out my phone to Google the area. The new roommates agreed to join me for a bit, though they mentioned they couldn’t stay out too late since they had work in the morning.
We strolled down to a nearby dive bar just about a block and a half away, and it felt like the perfect spot. It had everything: dartboards, a gorgeous bartender, touch tunes for music, grimy single-person restrooms, and to top it all off, incredible pub fries. I knew I’d be a regular there. Ian, the tallest of the roommates at 6’2”, had a girlfriend named Marly, whom he brought along. She was a petite 5’5” blonde with piercing blue eyes—a total knockout. Plus, she was feisty, and I loved that. Bantering back and forth was one of my favorite pastimes, and she was someone I could spar with.
Ian exuded a relaxed California vibe, having relocated from Seattle to take an engineering role at a large defense company in the area. With his sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, he was the quintessential embodiment of that effortless California cool.
Unfortunately, as charismatic as my roommates and their friends were, my boss turned out to be a total jerk. My Mondays through Fridays quickly spiraled into a nightmare once I started working for him. On my very first day, before I even had a chance to set up my laptop, he came out of his office, handed me a list of customers, and barked, “Hey Jake, here’s your customer list. Set up four meetings this afternoon, and I’ll go with you to meet them.” Without so much as a smile or a nod, he retreated to his office, leaving me stunned. “What the hell?” I thought. I had just met Rajesh for the second time, had no prior field sales experience, and was already feeling the jitters.
I had expected a bit of a ramp-up period—maybe a chance to familiarize myself with the companies in my territory, to reach out via email or phone, and to set up in-person meetings within a week or two. But no, it was sink or swim from the get-go. I managed to schedule three meetings for that afternoon, but Rajesh wasn’t satisfied. I quickly learned that he was never satisfied.
I lived in Manayunk, nestled on the far northeast edge of Philadelphia, while my office was located at the Philadelphia airport, in the far southeast corner of the city. My sales territory stretched back toward Manayunk and beyond, a solid fifteen-minute drive from where I had chosen to live. I had moved to that neighborhood specifically for its proximity to my sales territory, but that intelligence was ruined immediately by Rajesh’s ridiculous demands.
He made us all drive into the office every day before 8:00 AM, just to report to him. After that, I would have to make the trek back past where I lived, then head out to my sales territory. It wasn’t like I was doing anything productive in the office; he simply wanted to ensure we checked in with him so he could apply any additional pressure he deemed necessary. It didn’t matter how miserable the weather was—his rule was crystal clear: show up at the office every single morning by 8:00 AM, only to drive back out to my territory.
This madness forced me to wake up at the ungodly hour of 5:50 AM to shower, eat, and get ready for the day, sprint out the door by 6:50 AM, and endure a full hour-long commute to the office. Then, I’d have to turn around, get right back into my car and drive for another grueling hour-and-a-half to two-hour trek back out to my sales territory. It was pure insanity! The inefficiency of it all drove me absolutely nuts. Had I known that every single day would start at the airport office, I would have reconsidered my choice to live in Manayunk, or my choice to take the position at all.
With this uncompromising schedule, I couldn’t even make it to my territory until around 10:15 AM. By that time, I was already drained from two and a half hours of driving and seething with frustration about the entire ordeal—every. single. day. I tried to schedule around it and hunt for new opportunities with companies that hadn’t previously used us for shipping, but honestly, every place I walked into seemed to despise us. If they had ever used our services, it was usually because we had delivered incredibly shoddy work or demanded exorbitant fees for past shipments, leading them to swear off any future dealings. The few clients that did still use us relied on us for only select shipments; they wouldn’t consider us for others because we were just too pricey.
Philadelphia wasn’t exactly the vibrant metropolis of Los Angeles or New York; it felt like an aging, perhaps even dying city. I found myself utterly miserable in this role, and my boss was doing nothing to help. Rajesh was a relentless presence, constantly pressing me for updates on every little detail. It felt like I was suffocating under his scrutiny. I often wished I had taken that job in Houston instead.
Lauren and I had gotten entangled back into talking and trying to make a long-distance relationship work. I guess she didn’t realize how much of a stable force I was in her life until I was gone, so she would still want to talk nearly every night on the phone to discuss our lives and see if we could rekindle a relationship. I was relieved to have the distance between us because it meant I was no longer paying for every dinner or every bar tab when we went out. 
She had visited me for St. Patrick’s Day weekend, which I thought would be a romantic trip, but not only did we not have sex, but she also seemed to act more like a distant friend than a girlfriend—a distant friend that wasn’t even that fun. My roommates all loathed her. She came off as pretentious and a bit cold, though I suspected she was just nervous and didn’t want to lead me on if her feelings had changed. Maybe when she saw me in person again she realized that the spark was gone and to just try to let everything die. I was determined to pursue her as I had invested so much into the relationship and if she was giving me a hint of a chance at rekindling things, I was going to take it. I think that with my job as chaotic as it was, she was the one thing, besides my mom, that gave me some sense of stability. They were the only people that I’d share my stressors with and I needed some sort of an outlet with all of the stress Rajesh was attaching to the job.
It was difficult to make new friends in Philadelphia. Most of the people there had grown up there their entire lives and weren’t interested in making new friends. I was usually capable of charming groups of people for a night at a time out at the bars to have fun nights with random people, but it seldomly ended up in even exchanging phone numbers, let along developing any sort of a meaningful friendship. My roommates were also homebodies for the most part which didn’t help.
By April, Philadelphia was still grappling with frigid temperatures dipping to a bone-chilling 27 degrees. That was just the cherry on top of my misery. I couldn’t even indulge in my dissatisfaction with pleasant weather; it had to be dismal all around me. The driving alone made it feel like I was clocking in twelve to fourteen hours a day, compounded by the suffocating pressure, stress, and those late-night phone calls from Rajesh.  
All I needed to do was endure nine more months of this hell, and then I’d be free from repaying my relocation bonus. That $7,500 was the sole anchor keeping me from quitting right then and there. If I could have marched out the door at that moment, I would have; but the grim reality was that I hadn’t made or saved much money yet.
As summer rolled into fall, my relationship with Lauren was still rocky and uncertain. On a positive note, Lauren encouraged me to connect with her friend Zack, a Harvard-educated lawyer living in Washington, D.C. I thought it was a great idea and asked her to set up the introduction. Zack soon texted me, inviting me down to hang out with him in a couple of weeks. I was desperate for an East Coast friend, so I jumped at the opportunity. The drive down was a manageable 2 ½ hours, but just the thought of seeing a familiar face—someone I always enjoyed being around in group settings—felt like a much-needed boost.
That first weekend in Washington, D.C., turned out to be incredible. Zack and I hit it off like old pals. He was charming and effortlessly kept up with my energy, standing at a handsome 5’11” with striking blue eyes and light brown hair. His infectious smile and magnetic personality made him a chick magnet, and I loved being the master of getting my friends laid. By the end of the weekend, I had helped him score not once, but twice.
Zack genuinely enjoyed my company; I was a refreshing burst of fun and energy compared to the more buttoned-up lawyers he typically associated with. He had a close-knit circle of fellow attorneys we’d occasionally join for nights out, but we always found that our most memorable adventures happened when it was just the two of us, prowling the D.C. nightlife in search of ladies to charm.
There was a satisfying thrill in helping Zack score with women he might not have otherwise approached, so I was more than happy to keep the momentum going. We started hanging out at least once a month, a welcome reprieve from the repetitiveness of our lives. Both of us were feeling a little unhappy with our weeknight lives on the East Coast, and we shared a common goal of making our way back to the Phoenix area.
As June approached, my roommates and my lease was about to expire, but we all wanted to continue living together. So, we began the search for a new place, aiming for a location closer to the city that would also offer a wealthier and potentially more vibrant neighborhood. Manayunk was fun for what it was, but it was a real journey to get into the city from the location we were in. We wanted to be closer to the action. I thought maybe this would help us all get out together more often as well. The promise of better weather during the summer was a welcome change too. The winter was frigid, and I hadn’t experienced one in nearly a decade, and with the depression of work and Lauren on top of it, it was a little difficult to try to be happy at all.
We ended up finding a great row home in Fairmount that had four bedrooms across three stories, complete with a basement. The basement and the top floor each had bedrooms of their own, and both Bill and Alex eagerly claimed those spaces as they were the largest spaces.
On the second floor were two bedrooms and a shared bathroom, with one room significantly smaller than the other. I decided to negotiate for the smaller bedroom, figuring I could snag a great deal while still living in a prime Philly neighborhood. Ian, still in his relationship with Marly, opted for the larger of the two rooms to accommodate her visits. When the dust settled, I was thrilled to find that my monthly rent would be just $175 for the next twelve months. That left me with plenty of cash to spend on nights out at the bars to figure out how to try to turn my experience for the better. The rent was also low enough that if I decided to leave and head back to Arizona before our lease was up, I could easily manage the cost.
As the move to Fairmount progressed and Lauren continued to voice her uncertainty about our relationship in nearly every conversation, I decided it was time to explore what else was out there. A new phone app called “Tinder” had just burst onto the scene, offering users the chance to match with members of their preferred gender and initiate conversations that could lead to dates. To my surprise and delight, I found myself receiving a wealth of interest from attractive women through the app. I started going on a few dates, taking one girl to a Phillies game, another to a Dave Matthews Band concert in Camden, and gearing up for a highly anticipated night on August 13th at the Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake concert at Citizens Bank Park in South Philly with another.
The atmosphere at the concert was electric on August 13th, filled with anticipation and pulsating music, when I noticed my phone buzzing with a call from my mom. I didn’t pick up because it wasn’t an environment where I’d even be able to hear her, but moments later, a text popped up on my screen: “Jake, give me a call when you get this. I have some bad news.” My heart sank. “What else could be going wrong,” I wondered. I told my date I needed to step out for a moment and made my way to a quieter corner to call my mom back.
When she answered, her voice trembled slightly. “Hey Jake, I’m sorry to interrupt your fun, but your grandma has taken a turn for the worse. She’s no longer able to speak, and we’ve started hospice care at home. We set up a hospital bed in the living room, so she’s here with us, but she doesn’t have much time left. If you want to visit her one last time, your dad and I will buy your plane ticket to fly back.”
I felt a rush of emotions. I had never been particularly close to my grandma, but I cared for her deeply; she was family. It felt important to see her and offer comfort during this time, especially since we had never shared that close of a bond. I promised my mom I’d talk to my manager, Rajesh, to see if I could get the time off.
Trying to enjoy the rest of the concert with my date proved challenging. The information weighed down my thoughts.
The next morning, I sent Rajesh an email requesting to fly out on Friday to spend the weekend back in Arizona with my dying grandma. He swiftly approved the time off, and I called my mom to ask her to book my plane ticket. I was also thrilled at the prospect of seeing her again, as I missed her dearly. I missed my dad too and looked forward to spending time with him as well. Plus, I hoped to drive down to Tempe one night to catch up with some of my college friends.
The trip ended up being as good as could be expected. It was odd to just see my grandma lying mute in a hospital bed in the middle of the living room while we tried our best to comfort her with words and touch. It was nice to get back and be able to spend some time with my mom. I didn’t realize how much I missed her and how much just being around her seemed to be able to life me up. 
My grandma was expected to pass relatively soon after my visit. She held on longer than anyone anticipated, but sadly she passed away in early September. Since we were the only ones left who had been close to her at the end of her life, there wasn’t a funeral or gathering, making it feel like a quiet farewell.
After dealing with my grandma’s final arrangements, my parents were scheduled to embark on a cruise on October 12th to Mexico for my mom’s birthday.  Meanwhile, Lauren and I had plans to vacation in Belize together just before that in the middle of September. I looked forward to this getaway, hoping it would either breathe new life into our relationship or serve as a clear reason to finally break up for good, allowing me to pursue other women more aggressively in Philadelphia. Although I had been going on dates and sharing a few kisses, I hesitated to take things further since I was still trying to rekindle the relationship with Lauren.
Finally, the week of our trip arrived, and I was eager to step away from my boss’s relentless pressure and see where Lauren and I stood. Unfortunately, the vacation ended up raising more questions than providing answers. It felt like the beginning of the end for me; if she remained so uncertain about our relationship, I wasn’t going to continue being loyal and committed to her. I craved fun and wanted to explore whether other girls were interested in me.
A little less than a month after our trip to Belize, my parents were set to drive out to Los Angeles for their cruise to celebrate my mom's birthday. I can still picture my mother in her vibrant yellow shirt, wheelchair-bound, beaming with excitement as she prepared to board the ship. I hadn’t seen her smile that broadly in years. She seemed so excited to be getting out to experience life not being couped up in a house with my dad in Sun City. I was a bit surprised because when I had suggested and prodded for them to do more things they always had resisted.
My sister had gifted them the cruise tickets as a birthday present for my mom which was a surprise to us all. Their relationship had been strained for years, and they’d hardly spoken over the past five. My mom had struggled with substance abuse issues related to the medication prescribed for her multiple sclerosis. She would shop around for doctors, collecting pills that left her loopy to the point of slurring her words and often barely able to stay awake. I remember many evenings spent driving from the house I was living at in Tempe to their house in Sun City, Arizona, trying to help manage the situation when my dad seemed overwhelmed.
There was a time when she confided in the wrong doctor about her dark thoughts, revealing moments of vulnerability that led to a week-long stay in a mental health facility. Visiting her at the mental health facility was difficult, a reminder of the battles we faced. I watched as my mother’s health deteriorated alarmingly between 2006 and 2009. The combination of her chronic illness and escalating prescription drug use spiraled further out of control after they moved to Kentucky from 2009 to 2011. Eventually, when my dad, Josh, lost his job in Kentucky, they relocated to Arizona, seeking the solace of retirement in a golf course home in Sun City.
I won’t lie; I felt a twinge of excitement in the lead up to my parents’ cruise. Since it was international, their phones would lose service after the first day, giving me a much-needed rest from our nightly check-ins. I was used to those calls, where I reassured her that everything was fine and shared snippets of my life, which she always seemed to cherish. Really, most of the time, I just wanted to speak to her to make sure she wasn’t slurring her words and delirious from the drugs she was abusing. This brief break felt like a breath of fresh air. Plus, with my secretive plans to move back to Arizona soon, I wasn’t overly concerned about work so I could enjoy the time off of checking in on her and try to have a little fun at the same time.
The Saturday after my parents set sail, I decided to embrace spontaneity and dive headfirst into a whirlwind of fun. Eric and Jamie were in town for the weekend from Baltimore, and we made our way to Xfinity Live!, a pulsating bar hub nestled near the stadiums. With my relationship with Lauren having fizzled out, Eric and Jamie wasted no time making connections with a couple of charming girls who caught our attention amidst the lively crowd. Our day was a delightful mix of laughter, drinks, and flirtation, and after several hours of festivities, we retreated to my apartment, where the night took a fun turn.
As we continued to drink back at my apartment one of the girls that came back with us captured my attention. Standing at 5’5”, she had straight brunette hair that framed her face beautifully and a very nice body. She also radiated an irresistible sexual confidence that drew me in like a magnet.
After a couple more beers at my place, the girl I had taken an interest in and I made our way upstairs to my bedroom, the door closing softly behind us. She looked at me with a playful smile and asked what I wanted to do. With the thrill of the moment with her being the first new girl I was going to be hooking up with in about six years, I suggested we make out and see where the night would lead. Overwhelmed by desire to experience something sexual with someone new I wasted no time making my move.
She had already taken her shoes off before we got on the bed and started making out. She was wearing tight jeans, and I slowly unbuttoned them, and slid them down off her sexy legs. The anticipation was intense; she was already wet from my fingers teasing her pussy. I peeled off her red panties, eager to get to work. But as soon as I got closer, I caught the unmistakable scent—she was filled with someone else's semen. Clearly, she hadn't bothered to clean up after a recent encounter with another guy.
The smell hit me immediately, fishy and strong, but instead of being turned off, I felt a surge of humiliation and arousal. I was already committed, my face inches away from her, so I pushed forward, sliding my tongue into her. The mix of her taste and his was jarring at first, but the more I dived in, the easier it became to tolerate. She grabbed the back of my head, pressing my face into her dirty pussy, knowing she had complete control. The realization that she didn’t even respect me enough to clean up first only added to the intense mix of shame and desire I was feeling. I could only imagine what she was thinking about the loser that was licking another guys cum out of her.
When I finally pulled away, my face slick with their combined juices, I excused myself to the bathroom. After a quick piss, I returned to find her and her friend getting ready to leave. No hand job, no return on my efforts—just the lingering sense of being used. It was both disappointing and incredibly hot. I felt dirty, with their combined fluids drying on my face, and somehow, that was enough for me. The thought of what had just happened would fuel countless fantasies, knowing I had been made to clean her slutty, cum filled, perfect pussy after she'd been with someone else. The sense of humiliation was scorching.
The next day, Eric, Jamie, and I ventured to a lively bar in Fairmount called Bishop’s Collar. We settled in for an epic day of day drinking while soaking up the excitement of college football. By the time the weekend wrapped up, I felt rejuvenated and ready to tackle the workweek ahead. I had managed to hook up with a girl—sort of—and had an unforgettable weekend filled with a lot of fun.
Monday morning arrived, and I strolled into the office at the airport at 7:45 AM, dressed in a crisp dress shirt and slacks. As the meeting kicked off, my boss, Rajesh, launched into his presentation. About five minutes in, he suddenly halted, casting a critical eye my way. “Really? No tie, man? Wow. Do you have one in your car that you can put on? This is very disrespectful,” he scolded.
I felt my frustration bubble to the surface. I was already fed up with his antics, but I didn’t want to jeopardize my job. My plan was simply to endure until my year was up and then make my exit. As Rajesh continued to speak, I shrank in my seat, feeling as small and exposed as possible. Embarrassment washed over me, simmering into an anger. In a moment of dark humor, I found myself fantasizing about how I might get away with killing Rajesh. The thought was absurd (I’d never do it!), yet it oddly comforted me. “Sure, you can be a jerk to me. But just know, I could always take you out if I really wanted to,” I mused, relishing my fleeting sense of power.
Lost in my vengeful daydreams, I was abruptly jolted back to reality by the sharp snap of fingers. Rajesh was attempting to reclaim my attention. “Alright, everyone, I think we’re all tired. You’re free to go,” he declared, dismissing us with an nonchalant wave.
Despite the humiliation I felt from my boss’s patronizing behavior, I managed to say goodbye to my co-workers, but I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge Rajesh. I climbed into my car and drove back to my Fairmount home, determined to drown my frustrations in alcohol. The plan was simple: I would get as drunk as possible, hoping to forget the whole experience and numb the lingering embarrassment. I hit up Bishop's Collar in Fairmount, where I downed seven pints and four shots in a blur.
Around 12:30 AM, I finally decided it was time to call it a night and sleep it off, so I could be somewhat functional before heading out to my sales territory later in the morning. Thankfully, the Area Manager had caught wind of Rajesh's absurd demand for everyone to report to the office before 8:00 AM and had overruled him. The nightmare of those early mornings was finally over.
On most workdays, I didn’t expect to hear from Rajesh until 10:00 or 11:00 AM, so I would frequently sneak in an extra hour or two of drinking the night before and then sleep in a little bit. After the way I had been singled out in the meeting, I decided to drink a little more than usual and enjoy a couple more hours of sleep. At that point, I didn’t care anymore; if they caught me and fired me, so be it.
The next morning, I awoke to a barrage of missed calls—one from Rajesh on my work phone and another from my sister on my personal phone, which struck me as odd. Realizing it was already 10:30 AM, I jumped into the shower and threw on some work clothes, preparing to head out to my territory. Deciding to call my sister back, I braced myself for whatever news she had.
When she answered, her voice was thick with sobs. “What happened?!?” I asked, my heart racing. “You know,” she replied cryptically. In moments like that, you don’t know anything. “No, Kate. I don’t know. Please tell me,” I urged.
“Mom died,” she said.
“Oh, fuck. Oh my god. Are you serious? What happened?” I stammered, my heart racing as panic washed over me. Kate could only tell me that Mom had passed away on the cruise ship sometime during the previous night. To make matters worse, my dad hadn’t even bothered to call me.
I felt completely shattered. Just a month earlier, my grandma had died, and now my mom was gone too. A crushing wave of self-hatred engulfed me as I cursed my decision to move to Philadelphia, convinced that if I had stayed in Arizona, things would have turned out differently. “Will Dad be calling me?” I asked. She didn’t know, explaining that he wouldn’t have access to their cell phones while on the international cruise. Still, she promised to let him know I wanted him to call if he reached out to her again.
In an effort to keep my boss off my back, I called him to break the news. He listened attentively, understanding the gravity of the situation. After asking a few questions about what had happened, he assured me that I had the day off and likely the next as well. His sincere condolences felt oddly comforting, especially coming from him. For once, he sounded more like a compassionate human being than a dictatorial boss.
As I hung up the phone, a wave of grief washed over me. I sank onto my bed, desperately trying to summon tears, but something felt off; they just wouldn’t come. I couldn't just continue to sit at home alone. I needed to do something to try to distract myself from the horror of my life. Nothing seemed real.
I decided to venture out to the grocery store. I mindlessly picked up a few items I didn’t really need. Then I spotted a Redbox kiosk. I rented a couple of movies, desiring a temporary escape from the crushing reality of my loss.
I texted Lauren and my friend Stephanie to inform them of my mom’s passing, asking if we could chat when they had a moment. Lauren called almost immediately; her voice tinged with an unsettling excitement. “I had a bad feeling that something was going to happen!” she declared, sounding like a detective who had just cracked a case. My stomach churned in disgust; this wasn’t the time for her to flaunt her ego. “How could she be so insensitive when I needed her the most?” I thought. 
Stephanie called about ten minutes later, her tone sympathetic and genuinely warm. It was a relief to talk to her, and I found myself thinking how fortunate I was to have her in my life. 
Returning home, I felt a growing anxiety about my inability to cry. I was sad; I loved my mom deeply, yet the tears refused to flow. I realized that it had been years since I had cried. In a moment of clarity, I posted a heartfelt message on Facebook to commemorate my mother’s life and to notify friends and family of her passing. Almost immediately, messages flooded in—people shared their fondest memories of her, their heartfelt condolences, and prayers. “It’s nice to feel like people care,” I thought.
My roommates, having seen my heartfelt post, mentioned they were heading out to a haunted house that night. They hesitated, sensing that it might not be the best plan for me but urged me to join if I felt up to it. I thought it would be a good idea to get out of the house and keep my mind occupied so I accepted and went with them.
We made our way to the haunted house at the old Eastern State Penitentiary in Fairmount. It was a a welcome distraction from the weight of my mom's passing. However, whenever I caught myself laughing or losing my grief through distraction, a pang of guilt would wash over me, as if I were betraying her memory by allowing myself to enjoy the moment. After the haunted house, we headed to Bishop's Collar for a nightcap. They had cautioned me against drinking, and I agreed, choosing to stay sober that night.
While at the bar, I met a girl who was clearly intoxicated. Despite my situation, I kept the conversation light and friendly. She lived just around the corner, and when I offered to walk her home, she gratefully accepted, clearly too tipsy to navigate the streets alone. She stumbled across the street with me holding her up, and when we reached her front door, we exchanged pleasantries and shared a quick hug. As tempting as it was to ask for her number, I held back. With just losing my mom I wasn’t ready for anything at the moment.  It was hard enough to just put one foot in front of the other and keep moving forward at that point.
On the walk back to my house I took my time letting my senses to take in the details of my surroundings. I focused on the places along the street that I had previously overlooked. As I passed the Corinthian Gardens next to the prison, I paused to appreciate its unexpected beauty.
Once home, I took some sleeping medication, hoping it would help me get a little bit of sleep. However, sleep eluded me, and I was jolted awake the next morning by my phone ringing at 10:00 a.m. The number on the screen looked unfamiliar, but I answered it anyway, hoping that it was my dad calling from the cruise ship. To my relief, it was him.
“Hey Jake, it’s your father. I have some sad news—as you know your mother passed away yesterday in her sleep on the cruise,” he said, his voice heavy with sorrow. “I’m okay, but obviously sad. They’ve taken her body to the morgue on the ship. They aren’t fully sure what happened, but they’ll perform a complete autopsy when we get back to Los Angeles. How are you holding up?”
It was hard to come up with words. “How the hell am I doing?” raced through my mind, but I held my tongue. Instead, I replied, “I’m okay. I mean, obviously sad, but I don’t know if it’s fully hit me yet.”
My dad said he understood the struggle I was going through with it not hitting me yet. Unfortunately, he had limited time on the phone because they were out at sea and the call was international. “I love you,” he said, and as quickly as that, he had to end the conversation.
“Okay, love you too,” I responded, and just like that, the call was over.
My dad still had four days left on the cruise, with their destination city in Mexico approaching. They were set to dock there for the day tomorrow before heading back to Los Angeles. I couldn’t fathom how awful that must be: losing your wife and then being trapped on a ship with her lifeless body while surrounded by oblivious celebrators. It seemed worse than hell itself.
That afternoon, I discovered that the Corinthian Gardens I had passed the night before was hosting a planting event, and it struck me as a emotional tribute to volunteer, helping to plant new flowers in their garden plots in memory of my mom. I spent the day on my feet, assisting fellow volunteers and fetching water, feeling a bit of purpose amidst the overwhelming feeling of grief. There was even a sweepstakes drawing for those who helped, with the winner receiving their own flower plot to name. I hoped to win so I could dedicate it to my mom, but it wasn’t in the cards and my name wasn’t drawn.
My boss had given me the rest of the week off, but he did want to grab lunch nearby after a couple of days to check in on me. He was the last person I wanted to see, yet the prospect of a free meal with my dwindling bank account was tempting, and I thought it might earn me some goodwill which I desperately needed. We settled on an Indian restaurant not too far from where I lived, and conveniently close to Rajesh's office.
It was my first experience with Indian cuisine, and Rajesh recommended the masala—either lamb or chicken for a newbie. As we sat and ate, the atmosphere felt different; we spoke far less than usual. Typically, Rajesh bombarded me with endless questions, but today he seemed genuinely concerned about my situation, almost hesitant to intrude on my emotions. Perhaps he still felt guilty for the way he had treated me in that meeting right before my mom passed away.
At one point, he asked if I planned to fly back to Los Angeles to see my mom one last time after they returned. I found the question bizarre. “Who would want to see one of their parents a week after they had died?” I thought. The idea felt gross and morbid to me. I imagined her not looking like herself at all—motionless, lifeless. It was a vision I was sure that I’d rather avoid, but I told him I would think about it.
Truthfully, I had no idea where I would find the money to fly back to Illinois for the funeral. My finances had been consumed by nights of drinking and getting tangled up in “financial domination” with two girls from college. The weight of it all felt suffocating.
I was drawn to female domination, particularly a niche fetish known as “financial domination,” where a woman wields personal information and sometimes blackmail material over her male subjects to extort money through sexual humiliation. The girls I was doing it with knew I enjoyed being submissive, and they played along with my desires. I’d often ask them to call me their “bitch,” a title that made me feel extremely submissive to them. I found them to be a safer avenue to explore this fantasy with than a professional. We had a history and they knew me personally, which meant we could indulge in our desires but could also hit the brakes if things got too intense.
One of these girls was Victoria, a stunning blonde bombshell from Texas, standing tall at 5’7” with a long, slender frame, captivating blue eyes, and the kind of body that could grace any magazine cover. We had attended ASU at the same time and been introduced to each other a few times at events. We even had a picture together tagged on Facebook from a social where we were both talking for awhile. She had been crowned Miss Arizona several years ago, her beauty nothing short of breathtaking. At the time, she was dating a promising young baseball player in Triple-A, a hitter who seemed destined for the big leagues. If you’ve kept your ear to the ground in Major League Baseball over the past decade, you’d likely recognize his name. 
One drunken night just before moving to Philadelphia I had messaged her asking if she would financially dominate me.  What that meant was that I would send her a weekly amount of money in exchange for her not to tell Lauren or anyone else that I enjoyed being used and humiliated in this fashion. It quickly developed into her taking a very dominant role in the relationship and making me kneel in a tiny closet that was in my bedroom for hours at a time any time she thought I wasn’t being completely submissive to her.
In one of our more intense interactions, she had made me pick out and buy her an expensive set of Victoria’s Secret lingerie. Then, in a twist of domination that left me both exhilarated and humiliated, she instructed me to kneel in a closet, sending her video proof of my submission as she wore the very lingerie I had purchased for her while she fucked her boyfriend. I had given her my boss’s contact information as well as Lauren’s so she could force me to do any humiliating thing she wanted whenever she wanted.  I wasn’t allowed to say no to her and always had to submit to her when she would make a humiliation demand. I secretly loved it. The orgasms I would get over her treating me like her little bitch boy were incredible. The power dynamic between us blurred lines in ways I never expected intertwining pleasure and emotional pain in a surreal dance of control.
I had a particular fascination with cuckolding, and the combination of sexual teasing and humiliation from a girl as stunning as Victoria sent shivers down my spine. It was an intoxicating mix of degradation and desire, making my blood boil with a potent cocktail of shame and arousal. I fantasized in the thought of her boyfriend fucking her in the very lingerie I had bought for her, my heart racing as I knelt in the cramped closet like a devoted little servant.
By the end, I was cramping and sweating, the air conditioning in that tiny closet nothing more than a cruel joke. It felt more like an attic space with how hot it got in it. Finally, she let me know they were finished, and when I was allowed to emerge, she laid down a heavy ultimatum: I had to send her an extra $100, or she would unleash the videos and story of my submission to Lauren and my boss. I complied, knowing that the humiliation only heightened my desire; her playful taunts and extra demands to enforce my submission were all part of the thrill.
I tried to get out of the agreement about a month before my mom’s passing, but she said she wouldn’t let me. She stated that I would fulfill my agreement until the end of the year we had agreed upon or else she would share everything with Lauren. I let her know that I was struggling financially and she said that she didn’t care, this is what I had signed up for. I would pay her all of the rest of the money I had promised even if I had to do it in increments until the contract was fulfilled. 
Our financial blackmail dynamic had begun back in January when I moved to Philadelphia and had continued until my mother’s passing in September. After my mom passed, I messaged her and she let me know not to worry about it at all and just take care of myself.
Her boyfriend was blissfully unaware of our arrangement at first, but eventually she felt guilty doing it behind his back and told him about me, and he wasn't too pleased about it. When I found out later that she told him about it, I couldn’t help but imagine his shock and possibly intrigue at the idea that his serious girlfriend was dominating another guy in this fashion at the same time.  
The other girl, Sam, lived in Arizona and stood 5’3” with attractive brown hair and striking green eyes. She was one of the bartenders at Cue Club, the bar where we had my farewell party, where her vibrant personality lit up the room. Sam had a boyfriend, and I suspected he was aware of our arrangement, probably laughing together at my expense behind my back. The thought was oddly tantalizing.
With her sultry, petite frame, she had dabbled in local modeling for the bar and other establishments in the area. Her stomach was as sexy as it was toned, and she had demanded videos of me on my knees, begging her to let me be her little bitch. In drunken, lust-fueled moments, I would plead for her to make me eat dog food. Initially, she resisted, enjoying the build-up of my desperation, but eventually, she conceded and commanded me to fulfill my request.
I took a video myself wearing a dog collar, declaring my submission to her as her little bitch as I took a few reluctant bites of the dog food and sent it over to her. I could only imagine the laughter that ensued between her and her boyfriend as she shared the video with him.  Likely a mix of amusement and disbelief at my embarrassing antics.
Victoria and Sam each brought their own unique style of domination and I found myself paying both of them $75 a week to keep my secret and indulge in the fantasy of being their little bitch boy. Sam was much more reserved whereas Victoria was very direct and authoritative. It was a way for me to satisfy my sexual cravings all within a semi-safe framework that allowed me to explore submission to them without too many risks.
After my mom passed I did make it back for the funeral which was held at a church in my hometown. I was kind of surprised how few people showed up. I was expecting it to be a little fuller of people whose lives she had touched, because she was such a caring and helpful woman especially before the disease took control of her life and happiness.
I had booked a flight for Lauren to visit me after my mom’s passing, desperately seeking the comfort of someone I believed cared for me, regardless of whether our relationship was romantic or platonic. I was genuinely looking forward to her arrival; I needed emotional support more than ever.
However, after one of our nightly phone calls, Lauren texted me that she wasn’t sure if she still wanted to come to Philadelphia. My heart sank, crushed under the weight of this news. In a moment of frustration, I exploded on her. I texted her that if she couldn’t commit to visiting, she might as well stay home and never contact me again. With that, I immediately blocked her number, sealing the door on that chapter of my life.
I must admit, I was a complete momma’s boy. Now that my mom was gone, an immense void had opened up in my life, one that I desperately sought to fill. I realized I needed to find other distractions to occupy my mind. My mom had always been my emotional anchor, and I had been eagerly looking forward to moving back to Phoenix to spend precious time with her again.
Throughout my life, my dad had always seemed bothered by my problems, no matter how trivial they might be, which made my mom my confidant and the person with whom I shared my deepest emotions. With her absence, I felt lost. On top of that, I always harbored deep-seated, deviant submissive desires that had always lurked in the background, kept at bay by my mom’s presence. I didn’t want her to find out her son was a pervert. I felt ashamed of my perversive desires, but I never fully explored them, afraid that she would find out. With her gone, the restraints that had held me back vanished, leaving me to wonder what paths I might now explore.
The girls I had been playing with were fun, but they were amateurs and former friends so even though we’d toy with blackmail and threats of exposure I figured I would be able to talk my way out of it if I ever needed to. Perhaps what I truly craved was the expertise of a professional Financial Dominatrix who could quench my thirst for pure domination.
For years, I had followed the most popular financial dominatrixes online. They always posted videos of their “slaves” completing horrifying, degrading tasks for them. I frequently masturbated imagining I was the slave doing the acts demanded by them in their audacious displays of power over their slaves. 
The hottest of them all was a 23-year-old, 5’3”, 115-pound blonde bombshell named Goddess Jessica. With tan skin, piercing brown eyes, and an enticing smile that suggested she enjoyed the sexual humiliation of her “slaves,” she was a vision of pure temptation. I had orgasmed to her photos and Twitter escapades thousands of times, attracted by the way she manipulated authority over her male subjects.
She was, without a doubt, the most dominant and attractive woman I had ever seen, and I felt an insatiable urge to fully embrace the fantasy of serving her as her slave. With my breakup with Lauren, the relentless stress of my job, and the weight of my mother’s passing pressing down on me, I felt as though I had nothing left to lose. I was ready to dive headfirst into a world of financial submission, yearning for the sexual gratification that would come from being dominated by the hottest, most naturally commanding woman I had ever seen. Little did I know this decision would mark the beginning of a downward spiral into darkness, one that would lead me far deeper than I ever anticipated.

Chapter 2 – Goddess Jessica
During one particularly intense masturbation session, my mind drifted, fueled by a primal desire. I couldn’t shake the thought of Goddess Jessica, and my heart raced at the idea of sending her a message on Yahoo Instant Messenger, confessing my eagerness to serve her as her little bitch. With a mix of excitement and fear, I composed a message explaining my desires with my finger hovering over the “send” button, the anticipation swirling within me.
As I continued to stroke my dick, the moment built to a climax, and right before I came, I spontaneously slammed my finger down on the send button. A thrilling rush surged through me, flooding every inch of my body like an electric shock. It was explosive—one of the most intense orgasms I had ever experienced. But the euphoria quickly turned to panic.
In a frenzy went back to Yahoo Instant Messenger wondering if I could delete it before she read it. I couldn’t delete it and the anxiety twisted in my stomach. “What have I done?” I thought to myself. In a fit of panic, I deleted the entire app hoping to erase my reckless decision. While the orgasm had been amazing, I couldn’t shake the fear of how deeply I might plunge into darkness with her. Better to just convince myself that she would never see it and hope she never responded, allowing me to retreat back into the safety of my own mind.
The intensity of the memory of that orgasm clung to me, however. I had never experienced such ecstasy before, and it felt as though I had stumbled upon a new realm of pleasure, one that summoned me to explore further. Determined to recapture that unparalleled high, I decided to start masturbating to the thought of having sent the message while looking at her captivating images.
With eager anticipation, I progressed to her Twitter account, ready to plunge myself in the fantasy of submitting to her as her slave. As soon as I landed on her page, I realized I had made a huge mistake. My heart dropped when I saw her latest post—a screenshot of a Yahoo Instant Messenger conversation that seemed to belong to one of her slaves. I looked closer at the screenshot, and my stomach twisted in a knot.
“Fuck, she’s posting our conversation,” I realized, with equal parts anger and fear of her exposing a conversation I wanted to keep private. Alongside the screenshot of my own message, she had included her response, proudly displaying my vulnerability for all her followers to see:
“Fuck off! I don’t have time for a loser who lives in his mother’s basement and doesn’t have enough money to pay me.”
Her words struck like a slap in the face. My mother had just died, and this heartless bitch had the audacity to respond to me like that. I was fuming, a wave of anger surging through me as I furiously began typing a response on Yahoo Instant Messenger. “Just so you know, I saw your Twitter post, and I make around $75,000 a year. My mother passed away just this past week, so I certainly don’t live in her basement. If you don’t want me as your slave, I’ll find another Domme to serve!”
With that, I knew I could never masturbate to her again. The thought of her would only ignite my rage.
Later that day, I nervously checked my messages, half-expecting an apology. Surely, she couldn’t read my message and not feel a little remorse for her words. She had responded on Yahoo Instant Messenger, saying she was sorry for jumping to conclusions about my finances. “I deal with a lot of guys who waste my time,” she explained, her tone softening slightly. She offered me a chance to serve her and said that it would cost $100 a week if I was still interested.
Despite my declining finances I thought there was no way I could back out now. I didn’t have a lot of money leftover from bi-weekly paycheck, but I thought to myself, “I can manage this.” I went to the PayPal app and typed in her email address and sent $100 to get us started. 
The next day, she confirmed she had received my $100 payment. In the beginning our arrangement was exhilarating, filled with a sense of purpose and anticipation. I found myself developing clever ways to cut expenses, determined to increase the “tributes” I sent her weekly in addition to the $100 I was already sending. She had over fifty active slaves on Twitter, and I was starting from the very bottom of that hierarchy. I knew I had to do everything possible to catch her attention. Whenever she posted a link to something new on her Amazon Wishlist, I jumped at the chance to purchase it for her as long as it fell within my limited budget. 
Eager to impress her, I began tweeting responses to her posts and showering her with compliments about her beauty, dominance, and perfection. It was evident she enjoyed the praise. She asked for a photo, and I felt a surge of confidence. I was in decent shape from hitting the gym daily, so I sent her a picture where I tried to look as much like a model as possible.
To my surprise, her reply was short and direct: “No, I want one with all of your clothes off.” My heart raced. “Maybe she’s actually into me,” I thought. “Or at least she finds me attractive enough to want to see me naked.” But deep down, I knew I was mistaken on both counts. She demanded I create a Twitter account under the moniker “@WeakLittleBitch” where she could tag me and interact with me directly. I did as instructed, in no shape to negotiate or argue with a top tier Financial Dominatrix. 
In addition to the $100 a week I was sending her and the Amazon gifts I purchased whenever I could, she also offered “Skype Sessions” at $10 a minute, with a minimum duration of 10 minutes. I was eager to connect with her face-to-face, wanting her to see that I was not only good-looking but also funny and confident. Sure, I enjoyed my submissive role, but I wanted to stand out from her other timid, meek slaves. I aimed to be an intellectually stimulating slave for her as well.
After saving up some money, I managed to scrape together $100 for our first Skype session. When the moment arrived, she asked what I wanted to do. Most of the guys who Skyped with her were just interested in pleasuring themselves while staring at her while she teased them about their fetishes. Sometimes, she would verbally humiliate them or assign tasks to complete while they masturbated, often leading to their orgasms within just a few minutes, after which they would end the call abruptly.
But I had different intentions. I genuinely wanted to get to know her, to delve beyond the surface of our transactional relationship and explore the depths of her personality. This was more than just a chance for me to indulge in my desires; it was an opportunity to form a connection that transcended the typical boundaries of domination and submission.
I heard the Skype call ringing and felt a surge of anticipation as she finally picked up. She was every bit as stunning as the pictures, an absolute dream of a woman. Lying on her stomach, with her face pressed into the frame and her feet playfully kicked up in the air, she radiated an irresistible charm. I was dressed casually in a t-shirt, and while my shorts were out of frame, I would have easily passed a “hand check” since I wasn’t playing with myself. I wanted to focus entirely on the woman she was during our time rather than trying to pleasure myself.
Her voice was unlike any I had ever encountered, it was warm, inviting, and addictive. Her natural way of speaking could put you in a trance. Talking to her was a delight; she teased me, asked probing questions, and genuinely seemed interested in my fetishes. I had no intention of holding back; I wanted this to grow into a long-term connection, so I opened up about everything that intrigued me, from cuckolding to chastity.
When I mentioned chastity, she stopped me in my tracks, her eyes widening with excitement. “Chastity? Yum. Would you wear a cock cage for me?” she asked, her tone so confident it made the hair on my neck stand up. I was taken aback by her ability to ask these questions without a hint of hesitation. “Uh… yeah, if you wanted me to,” I replied, my heart racing.
“Okay, I want you to,” she declared. “I’ll send a link to my favorite. Buy it and let me know when it arrives. I want you to send me the keys.” “Okay,” I said, still trying to process everything. “Okay, what, slave?” she challenged. “Okay, Goddess,” I responded, a blush creeping onto my face.
As Skype call approached the twelve-minute mark, I didn’t want to waste any more of her time since I had only paid for ten minutes. I wanted to be a good slave. “Goddess, we’re past time. This was amazing. I really appreciate it,” I said. Her response was playful and dismissive: “Bye, moron,” and just like that, she abruptly shut off her camera. I burst out laughing; this girl truly didn’t give a shit. I had never experienced anything like it before, and I found myself fully captivated by her.
She seemed to view me as one of her more attractive slaves, enjoying the chance to post pictures of the tasks she made me do on Twitter. I didn’t hold back either; I wanted her to see me as entertaining. Before long, the other slaves began to notice our interactions, and started to interact with me on Twitter with greetings or comments on my posts. It felt exhilarating—I was finally “in the club” after a month or two of trying to earn my place in her world.
When I was feeling a bit too cheeky or she simply wanted to test my patience, she would demand that I write “lines” for her. These lines involved typing the same phrase over and over in a computer program, and any mistake I made would add another line to the expanding list. It typically began something like her commanding, “Okay, Jake. Go write 10 lines saying, ‘Goddess Jessica is the sexiest, most lovable Goddess in the Universe, and I am an insignificant whiny little bitch.’ Send me a screenshot when you’re done.” But by the time I stumbled over a few keys, that simple request would expand to a staggering seventy lines or more, leaving me scrambling to catch up with all the errors.
To make matters worse, my spacebar was unreliable, only working about half the time. So, as I furiously typed, it often failed to register between words, leading to further penalties. The frustration was climbing, and I was dangerously close to throwing my laptop out the window in a fit of rage.
During the chaos of my line-writing ordeal, she asked about the chastity device I had ordered. I informed her that it had arrived but was a total disaster—it was from China and slipped off my nuts the moment I tried it on. “Oh, damn,” she replied flatly, and just like that, she ended the conversation, leaving me to stew in my failure and frustration.
My roommates and I were set to part ways in June of 2024, just a few months after my mom’s passing. I didn’t have much of a plan. One of my roommates, Alex, offered me a spot on his couch for $500 a month, and it sounded like a solid deal with no other prospects at the time, so I jumped at the opportunity. It would be nice to still be living with someone I considered a friend, and he was moving to a place in South Philadelphia which would be even better for my commutes into the office. We would also be within a mile of the major sports stadiums and concert venues. A brand-new neighborhood full of bars awaited exploration, which had me pretty excited. 
Alex expressed his desire to join a recreational sports league and invited me along. I figured it would be a great opportunity to get out, have some fun, and possibly meet some cute girls.  We signed up for a softball league that was set to kick off the following week, looking forward to meeting some new potential friends.
Over the next few weeks, it felt like she was slowly distancing herself from me while simultaneously asking for more money from our dynamic. I didn’t feel like I was receiving the attention and humiliation I needed, especially considering the $100 a week I was shelling out. Our agreement felt increasingly lopsided; if she didn’t value the commitment we had made, I figured the odds of her enforcing it were low. If she wasn’t going to appreciate my financial tribute, I would simply shift my focus to serving a different Financial Dominatrix.  
I had no intention of being cruel; I just needed more engagement. The thrilling experiences and explosive orgasms I once enjoyed with Goddess Jessica had faded, leaving me unsatisfied. So, I decided to stop responding to her messages. After a week or two of silence, I sensed she finally realized I had moved on.
Goddess Rene was a popular Dominatrix on Twitter, known for her commanding presence. Standing tall at 5'9", she was also a blonde, with striking brown eyes. While she was skinnier than Goddess Jessica, her fit physique had a certain allure, just not the athletic build Goddess Jessica had.
Rene had a sexy pelvic tattoo that wrapped around her bikini line, written in Latin and translating to “The girl never cries.” Her cute toes and sexy feet were featured in numerous humiliating real-time clips, where she would make her slaves dress up in frilly maid outfits and kneel to worship her by sucking on her toes. I had jacked off to fantasies of serving her nearly as much as I had with Goddess Jessica.
I tracked down Goddess Rene's email address through her Twitter account and reached out, asking if she offered financial domination and would be willing to take me on as her keyholding slave for $100 a week. Although Goddess Jessica had been incorrect about chastity devices, I ended up finding a plastic one that appeared to be a viable option. To my delight, Goddess Rene replied within a few hours, confirming that she could indeed take me on as her slave, but she was leaving for a vacation abroad in just three days, so I needed to act fast if I wanted her to receive the keys in time.
Living in Las Vegas, I rushed to the UPS Store and found a $112 shipping option that would get my keys to her before she left. With my dick locked away in the plastic device, the thought of my keys soaring through the skies on an airplane created a thrilling mix of anxiety and excitement. Finally, the day before her flight, she confirmed that the keys had arrived. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief and a surge of horniness.
I discovered that I could still pleasure myself using a Q-Tip through the holes of the chastity device. The compression of my dick and balls produced orgasms that were nearly as satisfying as my usual orgasms.
As I followed her updates from her European vacation with her husband, I couldn't help but admire her. She looked like the epitome of a milky-white Instagram model, radiating with a dazzling smile, enviable curves, and those sexy feet. I had masturbated frequently to videos of her playfully shoving her sweaty feet into the mouths of her submissives, teasing, “How do you like the taste of my sweaty feet, you little bitch? Say you’re Rene’s little bitch, slave.”
She exuded the same dominance as Goddess Jessica but with an even hotter portfolio of real-time clips where she humiliated her slaves in person. It was all too easy for me to envision myself as one of those submissive slaves, experiencing Earthshattering orgasms under her command. I decided that she would fill the void left by Goddess Jessica in my life.
I quickly realized that Goddess Rene didn’t engage with her slaves as much as she had early in her career, or perhaps she was simply too preoccupied during her vacation to make time for me. I found myself missing Goddess Jessica. Even though our communication had decreased in the weeks leading up to my silence, there had at least been some connection. Goddess Rene, on the other hand, had simply accepted my chastity keys and dashed off to France, leaving me feeling abandoned and ignored.
That night, as I drove back to my apartment, I received a Yahoo Instant Message that made my heart skip a beat—it was from Goddess Jessica! It contained an ASCII representation of a dick. “Nice,” I replied, feeling a surge of nostalgia. “I’m kind of bored with my current Goddess. Want to give it another shot?” “Sure,” she responded, “but this time there will be more rules.” I wasn’t in a position to negotiate, so I simply replied, “Ok.”
A couple of hours later, she messaged again with her demands: “First off, you aren’t allowed to tag me in more than five Tweets per day. Second, you need to start wearing a chastity cage for me immediately until I say otherwise. And third, I want you to fill out a slave contract this time, so you can’t just leave again.”
Hearing her insistence on trapping me with a contract sent a thrill through me; I was rock hard at the thought. This was the kind of dominance I craved. I eagerly assured her that I agreed to her terms, ready to dive back into the intoxicating world of submission to her.
Goddess Jessica sent the slave contract via email, and as I opened it, I was greeted by a formal introduction outlining the terms of our twelve-month commitment. Opting out of the contract would come with a hefty fine of $2,000, a clear reminder of the gravity of my decision. The contract laid out the new rules governing our dynamic:
•	I will complete all tasks assigned to me.
•	I will check in at least twice a week.
•	I will not be needy, cry, or whine.
•	I will maintain a respectful demeanor.
•	I will not talk back or cancel payments.
•	I will always address her as Goddess Jessica, acknowledging her as my superior.
•	I will not attempt to serve other Dommes; doing so will result in a $500 fine.
I glanced over the document, but my desperation to feel her power and aura again made me willing to sign anything. There was also a model release included, as she enjoyed posting pictures of the humiliating tasks, she had me perform. I skimmed through it and signed it at the bottom. Without a scanner, I let her know that I’d swing by FedEx/Kinko’s the following day to scan and email the contract to her. I promptly sent her the $100 for the first week, filled with hope that our relationship would be as fun as it had once been. I was determined to work harder, proving my devotion and striving to be the best slave I could possibly be for her.
I was completely smitten with her, head over heels in love, and she knew it.
The next morning, I drove to the FedEx Kinko’s near our apartment, eager to scan and email the completed contract to her. After paying for the service, I messaged her a couple of hours later to check if she had received everything. She confirmed she had received the $100 payment via PayPal but hadn’t seen the contract yet. “That’s odd,” I replied, my heart racing.
Calling Kinko’s, I discovered they had entered her email address incorrectly. As I spelled it out over the phone, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of embarrassment and amusement. I had just given the clerk her full email address, complete with the word “Goddess,” and he had seen the slave contract too. Miraculously, my voice didn’t even tremble. Maybe I was still in shock from losing my mom; I was starting to realize just how desensitized I had become to embarrassment.
Goddess Jessica had met a guy in Hawaii and was spending most of her time with him. I could sense that she had shifted her focus to enjoying herself with her new boyfriend, which was fine with me. I secretly enjoyed the cuckold angle. He stood 6’3” with a muscular yet lean build, and while I had no doubt he was attractive (she wouldn’t post his face), I convinced myself I could take him in a fight.
Feeling a little mischievous, I decided to start tweeting a jab or two at him each week, but he hardly ever responded. “Typical alpha behavior,” I thought with a smirk.
I was running low on cash, as Goddess Jessica had discovered every possible way to fine me. We had just embarked on our second stint as Goddess and slave, and it felt like she was conjuring up new fines every single day. After signing the contract, I found myself constantly on edge, wondering when the next penalty would hit. There was no escaping this time; I was locked in for at least a year. It was clear she was determined to mold me into a quieter, more submissive version of myself, but it wasn’t exactly the fun kind of transformation I had hoped for.
After a couple of weeks, I decided it was time to try Skype with her again. Maybe seeing each other’s faces would rekindle some of the warmth in our relationship; at that moment, it felt as if I were just a number in her roster of slaves. I had saved up $100 but with my roommate at home, I couldn’t find the privacy to call. So, I stepped outside and hit the “call” button. When she picked up, I was greeted with a playful “Hey, loser,” accompanied by a teasing smile.
We chatted mostly about her day, and she threw a few questions my way about my life as well. The conversation flowed more easily than I expected; it felt refreshing compared to the usual barrage of fines and reprimands I endured on Twitter. As we wrapped up, she mentioned she wanted me to do something for her. There was a viral trend going around for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and she wanted to kick it off with her slaves. “Get naked,” she instructed, “and make sure you still have your chastity device on.”
“Of course,” I replied, a rush of excitement coursing through me. “Now, get in the shower with your chastity device on, do the ice bucket challenge, and then nominate one of my other slaves. Send me the video, and I’ll post it on Twitter.” I thought it was a brilliant idea and felt honored to be the chosen one to start it. Perhaps we were on better terms after all. I lied to her and let her know that I didn’t love her, but that I really liked her.  I was crossing paths with another Philadelphian on the sidewalk and she responded, “I can promise you that I’ll never like you at all, Jake,” and he chuckled as he shuffled by me.
I immediately dashed to the store for ice and grabbed a few beers on the way back. After downing about six beers, I felt ready to take the plunge. Around 11:00 PM, I stripped off my clothes and hopped into the shower, making sure to keep my voice down since my roommate was nearby. I started the camera, setting it up on the bathroom counter, and announced, “This is @WeakLittleBitch, and I’m doing the ice bucket challenge for Goddess Jessica,” before pouring the ice over my head. The icy water was shocking, but somehow, I managed not to scream. I ended the video by nominating another one of her slaves to take on the challenge next.
The next day, as I was taking a piss, I twisted the chastity cage a bit too much, and the plastic lock snapped off. I chuckled to myself, “I guess I won’t need the keys after all.”
I was still running low on cash due to all the fines, and I started brainstorming ways to make some extra money. I had seen countless clips that dominatrixes were posting and selling, and I thought, why not give it a shot? I had the looks and muscles, so I decided to take the morning off work and film a POV clip where I instructed a submissive to stick a plunger up their ass, suck a doorknob like it was a cock, and then cum at the end of the video, licking it up off the floor.
I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out and posted it on a clip website for sale. Eager for feedback, I showed it to Goddess Jessica. She laughed her ass off while watching it with her boyfriend. As a task, she instructed me to do everything I had said the submissive should do in the POV video and send it to her for her to keep as leverage. Secretly, I found it incredibly hot that she wanted me to do that, even though I faked some reluctance so she wouldn’t suspect I’d be jerking off to the thought later.
Outside of my new side hustle, my social life revolved around the bar right below our apartment and playing softball with my roommate on our new team. We weren’t exactly the best team, but it was a fun distraction from my drowning financial situation. After our first game rain started pouring down and we decided to take refuge in a nearby bar.
Alex and I hit it off with a couple of older guys, Jeff and Rob, as well as a cute Asian girl named Hayley. She had a sexy little body, even though it was clear she didn’t work out. After that, we started hanging out together frequently—after softball games, during work nights, and on weekends. I found myself trying to flirt with Hayley, only to learn over time that she was a lesbian. I was taken aback, but Jeff couldn't believe I hadn’t figured it out before making an idiot of myself.
Despite her orientation, I didn’t give up entirely; I just toned down my advances. We continued going out to bars together, and I met her two roommates, Laura and Amy, during our outings.
Laura stood at about 5'7", with flowing brown hair and striking green eyes. Her body was undeniably attractive, boasting a sexy tight figure and long legs complemented by her big breasts. While she shared the same name as the sorority girl from my Houston escapade, she was a world apart in demeanor. Laura had a sultry look that carried an edge of sass, giving her a sensual, almost mischievous vibe. Despite her lively appearance, she was always genuinely kind to me, creating a delightful contrast that drew me in even more.
Amy stood at about 5'3" with dazzling blonde hair and blue eyes that could stop traffic. A total bombshell, she boasted a 34D bust that reminded me of a porn star. Her body was fit and toned, with a hint of softness.  Unlike Laura, who wore her beauty with a touch of modesty, Amy had a confidence that radiated from her; she knew she was stunning. I’d have been more than happy to date either of them, but they seemed to see me only as a friend, despite my attempts to send out flirtatious vibes.
Both were studying Audiology at the same college in Philadelphia and had moved in together. As time passed, Laura and I began to hang out a bit more, and I started to wonder if there might be a spark between us.
By September, Alex, my roommate, had finally reached his limit with my couch-surfing lifestyle. One night, after a particularly wild evening, I passed out on the toilet—just before my chastity lock broke—and he had to pry the door open, discovering me in an embarrassing position. That might’ve been the last straw. My finances were still in disarray due to Goddess Jessica's relentless fines, but I managed to find an apartment right off Broad and Girard, an Asian student housing complex near the heart of the city. At just $300 a month, it was a steal compared to the $500 I was paying to crash on Alex’s couch. It was two girls living in the apartment, with one set to move out, so they were ideally looking for a girl. I had to borrow from my 401(k) in order to afford to move anywhere new because my finances were in such disarray from the constant financial pressures of Goddess Jessica.
When I visited the apartment, I was polite and respectful and tried to exude as kind of a vide as I could while meeting the potential roommates and looking at the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom.  The kitchen and bathroom needed to be cleaned, but for $300 a month I was more than happy to do the work on that. My two roommates were slender Asian girls who communicated in very limited English, which made things a bit interesting. I let them know I would love to move in if they would have me.
A few hours later, I received a text saying that despite my gender, they felt comfortable enough to welcome me into their apartment. I felt a wave of relief wash over me.
The next day, Alex and I said our goodbyes. He reassured me that even though we wouldn't be living together anymore, we’d still be friends. We hung out a couple more times, but the move ultimately put a damper on our relationship, marking the end of an era.
Now that I was settled into my new apartment, I found myself without cable TV, but I did have the internet, which became my lifeline. I dove headfirst into a binge-watching spree, exploring shows I had never seen before. I devoured Breaking Bad, Dexter, Rescue Me, The Sopranos, and Sons of Anarchy, and they became my primary source of entertainment alongside the occasional night out at the bars. Goddess Jessica, however, was relentless in her demands for money, constantly finding new ways to fine me, which meant my outings to bars were limited. She would frequently forbid me from going out, and I felt an overwhelming sense of dread under the weight of the contract binding me to her. It felt eerily reminiscent of the dull days when I had first left her, and I began to brainstorm escape routes. I just needed to find a way to avoid the $2,000 buy-out clause.
To add to my obligations, I was handling DMCA link removal emails for her, as well as summarizing custom video requests from her clients. The DMCA removals were straightforward; she simply wanted me to scour search engines for links to her videos and send a template takedown request to the webmasters. The custom video requests, however, were a little more complex. Many clients would submit ideas that were vague or nonsensical, leaving me to decipher their intent and summarize what Goddess Jessica would be creating in response. I thought she probably valued my input because I shared many of the same fetishes as her clients, giving me a unique insight into their requests. Occasionally, I would also send out contracts to new slaves or modify existing ones to cater to specific needs. All this work was tedious and lacked any real thrill. I often found myself spending a few hours each day tackling these tasks, and when I ran out of things to do, she would instruct me to dig deeper into the internet for more of her clips.
One day, while waiting in a company’s lobby for a meeting, I was scrolling through Findom Twitter when I decided to comment on one of Goddess Lindsay L's pictures, complimenting her beauty. Knowing she was friends with Goddess Jessica, I thought it was a nice gesture. To my surprise, Goddess Lindsay L publicly responded, demanding that I purchase five of her clips and send her the receipt immediately or face a block. I was taken aback—there was no way I would comply with that. I had only been trying to be friendly, and I certainly wasn’t interested in spending more money on her when I was already strapped for cash with Goddess Jessica.
In another twist, Goddess Lindsay L tweeted again, tagging Goddess Jessica and saying, “I think this is one of yours? He owes me five clip buys.”
Feeling the need to keep Goddess Jessica in the loop, I sent her a message, even though it was early morning in Hawaii. “Hey, I tagged Goddess Lindsay L in a Tweet just trying to be nice and say she’s sexy. Now she’s tagging you and demanding that I buy five of her clips, which I’m not going to do. Just a heads up.”
I continued my day, checking my messages periodically to see if she had replied. A couple of hours later, I finally got a response from Goddess Jessica. “Fuck you, Jake. I can’t even sleep without you doing something annoying. Buy the five clips from her and then send the receipt. After that, don’t message or tag her in Tweets anymore. I can’t protect you from her if you do.”
Reluctantly, I followed her orders, purchasing the clips and posting a screenshot of the receipt. My bank account decreased to a meager $50, with payday still three days away. Desperate to keep my head above water, I submitted an expense report for my mileage with the company, hoping it would get approved and processed quickly, providing me with the funds I needed to survive.  Luckily, it did.
Another slave, known by the moniker @Lurker, began messaging me privately. He noticed my struggles in submitting to Goddess Jessica and offered to help. He recommended a couple of clips, claiming they contained hidden messages that would aid me in my submission. Grateful for his advice, I decided to purchase the clips once I got paid again.
I eagerly listened to one of the clips and then messaged him to share that I hadn’t quite grasped the hidden message he mentioned. His simply responded, “Keep listening on repeat until you understand.”
Determined, I dove back in, replaying the video and listening intently. However, all I could hear was the same phrase repeated over and over again. There couldn’t possibly be the hidden message. I turned my focus to the background sounds, the subtle nuances in the clip, and the visuals accompanying the audio. After what felt like an eternity—about an hour and a half—I had a revelation: there was no hidden message at all. John wasn’t genuinely trying to help me; he simply wanted to hypnotize me into mindlessly serving Goddess Jessica and sending her even more money.
Fueled by frustration, I messaged him, declaring that I had figured out his little scheme and to simply “fuck off forever.” He replied with a half-hearted apology, insisting he was only trying to guide me on my path. But I didn’t want to hear another word from that asshole. He could go to hell for all I cared.
I found that I no longer worried about my friends knowing I had a dominatrix now that I wasn’t with Lauren anymore. I started sharing pictures and stories with a select few in my circle. They were added to a group text that included Zack, Patrick, Mike J, and the other Mike, where we chatted about sports, girls, and weekend plans. I would also give them the latest updates on Goddess Jessica.
I found it amusing that I had a hot dominatrix, and my friends not only approved of her attractiveness but also enjoyed hearing about my adventures with her. Of course, I decided to leave out the most embarrassing tasks she made me do; I didn’t want them to think any less of me.
One of the more explicit tasks I found myself subjected to was called the “Loser Fountain.” The premise was simple yet deeply humiliating: drink a glass of water or beer, then hop into the shower, prop your legs against the wall, aim your cock at your face, and open your mouth wide. You can probably guess what came next—yes, I pissed in my own mouth. Goddess Jessica loved assigning this degrading task to her slaves, me included, demonstrating just how easily she could manipulate us into doing whatever she desired.
I often found myself fantasizing about her laughing at my humiliating video of the Loser Fountain alongside her boyfriend. She had total control over my sexuality, able to compel me into performing any act of degradation she wished. All it took was for me to stroke myself to the thought of her exquisite images and to imagine her demanding I fulfill those embarrassing tasks in person. She had the power to make me do anything.
One particular video featured a police officer arriving at her hotel room in New York City. There, he knelt in his uniform and obediently worshipped her sweaty feet while she called him her “little bitch boy.” It was a potent reminder of her ability to make almost any man submit to her will. Perhaps that was why she sported revolver tattoos pointing towards her pussy; once a man became addicted to her allure, there was no turning back, and she knew exactly how to trap every man who approached her.
With my bank account always hovering around the bottom and facing an onslaught of creative fines every few days, I desperately sought another source of income. My previous video clip creation had flopped as it sold exactly zero copies, so I resigned myself to letting that dream go. While browsing Craigslist, I stumbled upon an ad from a guy who owned a company that set up bouncy castles for children’s birthday parties on weekends. The hours were long and involved plenty of windshield time, but it seemed like a fun gig—and a great workout. Even at just $10 an hour, I figured any income would be a lifeline.
Meanwhile, I had given up on my daily job. I was stuck in probation due to my failure to secure any new business since my first month or two, my boss was insufferable, and I had no desire to remain there. In my mind, if I lost my job and fell into financial ruin, Goddess Jessica would have no leverage to enforce the contract. She could claim I owed her $2,000, but if I had no money, that figure became nothing more than an arbitrary number.
As my attempts at trying to woo Hayley faded—she was a lesbian, after all—I began spending more time alone with her roommate, Laura. Perhaps my efforts were finally paying off. I was also annoyed with the constant trips to gay bars, so hanging out with Laura in more conventional settings was a refreshing change. One night, after a fun outing, Laura invited me to sleep over. Given that she lived only half a mile away, her invitation could only mean one thing: “She wants to hook up,” I thought, my heart racing with anticipation.
We raided the fridge, laughter bubbling between us as we stumbled upon a bottle of red wine. I poured a generous glass for each of us, and we settled into the living room, sipping the wine while reminiscing about the night. Laura, with a playful glint in her eye, eventually asked if I wanted to head to bed. My heart raced; it was a definite yes. I could hardly wait to feel the warmth of her body against mine, my tongue exploring her soft pussy lips. She exuded a confident sexiness that drew me like a moth to a flame.
As she stripped down to her bra and pajama pants layered over her panties, I couldn’t help but watch. The bra hugged her body perfectly, accentuating her toned stomach and the alluring curve of her full, tight breasts. I followed suit, shedding my shirt and pants before crawling into bed beside her. She switched off the lights, and I thought, “This must be my cue to make a move.”
Laura laid down turned away from me, so I snuggled up close, propping myself on my elbow and letting my hand rest gently on her side. She remained unresponsive to my advances. Doubt crept in, and I didn’t want to push further, fearing the sting of blatant rejection. I had dropped enough hints—if she wanted to hook up, surely she would have responded.
Rolling onto my back, I resolved to try and fall asleep instead. The soft warmth of her presence lulled me into a light slumber until she woke me at around 9:30 AM. She helped me dress and called an Uber to take me back home. Later that day, I received a text from her asking for cooking instructions for a steak. She mentioned she had a guy coming over that evening and wanted to impress him with a delicious meal. It turned me on to know she was flaunting another man in my face.
I responded eagerly, providing her with detailed cooking instructions as if I were her submissive little bitch. The thought of her using my steak recipes to impress some other guy sent waves of arousal through me. I felt utterly used, and the sensation only heightened my desire; it was thrilling and humiliating all at once.
My new apartment was situated just a short fifty-foot walk to the subway. From there, I could zip anywhere from Center City to South Philadelphia near the stadiums in under twenty minutes. As I settled into my new routine, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had spiraled too deeply into my entanglement with Goddess Jessica. It became painfully clear that she never truly cared about me; for her, financial domination was merely a way to extract as much money from me with as little effort as possible.
What had once been a thrilling experience turned monotonous and draining once again. I found myself working every weekend, setting up and collecting bouncy castles, but even that income wasn’t enough. I struggled to stay afloat, trying to maintain my position in her good graces while also longing for some semblance of joy in my life. I found myself deep in thought, pondering ways to escape the suffocating grip of the contract without forking over the $2,000 fee.
One day, as I drove home after visiting a handful of clients in my territory, I stopped in four or five of them, casually dropping off my card to log the visits as meetings. It was all part of my plan to keep the gas mileage reimbursement looking consistent. While I was scrolling through Facebook, a post caught my eye—a girl sharing her experience dealing with a sociopath. I had always associated sociopaths with criminals or murderers, not someone you might bump into in everyday life.
Intrigued, I decided it was time to delve deeper into the world of sociopaths, so I Googled the term. What I discovered was nothing short of shocking. I learned that between 1% and 4% of people exhibit sociopathic traits, and most aren’t criminals in the traditional sense. Many of them have learned to navigate society’s rules while exerting incredible pressure on others to bend to their will. The traits listed were unsettling: reduced empathy, an inability to care about others, and an affinity for manipulation. “This is fascinating,” I thought, though a feeling of darkness was growing inside me realizing people like that were actually out there.
“Holy shit. A lot of these traits fit Goddess Jessica to a T,” I realized, my heart racing. “Did I unwittingly enter the lair of a sociopath? How could someone so beautiful harbor such darkness within?” The thought seemed absurd, but the more I explored, the more convinced I became.
I started sifting through her Twitter posts, and one in particular struck me hard: “I have to fly today. Everyone feel bad for me when I take off, when I’m in the air bored, and then again when I land.” “Everyone feel bad for me…” I echoed in my mind, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks. “She can’t feel. She’s literally stating it right here. She possesses no ability to experience emotions beyond rage and anger. She’s a fucking sociopath.”
Terror gripped me. This was no innocent role-play; she was intent on dismantling my life piece by piece. I needed to escape this nightmare as quickly as possible. Yet, beneath my fear was a little bit of curiosity. “How do these people exist?” I pondered, both horrified and fascinated by the darkness of her twisted world.
I desperately needed to get out of the agreement, but I knew that she would enforce it ruthlessly. She held all the damning evidence—videos of the humiliating acts I had been forced to endure. I had taken plungers up my ass for her, eaten my own cum, sucked on doorknobs, and even pissed in my mouth—all utterly degrading acts that, if exposed, would bring severe embarrassment and likely cost me my job. On top of that, she had my work details, my boss's contact information, and even my father's phone number. She had nothing to lose by revealing my secrets, while I stood to lose everything. She thrived in her dominant role, and I was the one who had willingly subjected myself to her degrading whims. I needed to turn the tables, to create an environment where she would be the one wanting to end the agreement.
The strain had become unbearable. It felt like a house of cards on the brink of collapse. I decided to stop worrying about her exposing me to my job or my dad; it was time to cut ties completely no matter what. She had brought in new slaves who seemed to excite her more than I ever did. She even had one create the Twitter handle @GJFavorite, a cruel reminder that I was no longer her top priority. Maybe I never was. They were showering her with money, and she was acutely aware of how much she had already drained from me. I suspect she enjoyed the idea that when my funds ran dry, I would finally fall silent, expecting that I could somehow turn off my own voice. Here I was, penning a book about my experiences, not exactly the behavior of someone who would just shut up and fade away.
What had once ignited my spirit—a thrilling journey with a beautiful woman—had morphed into a nightmare that made me feel nauseous at every waking moment. Even in my dreams, I found no respite; they were filled with themes of her systematically destroying my life. It was clear to me that we had reached the end of the road. I decided I would stop paying her that week, even if it meant she would unleash my darkest secrets upon my family and employer. I was done. I needed out.
Instead of severing all ties with Goddess Jessica, I decided to adopt the “I went crazy” approach. I feared her retaliation, knowing she wouldn’t hesitate to use her leverage to keep me under her control. So, I concocted a plan: I would make her fear me instead.
I began to devise a plan that was as bold as it was reckless: I started creating multiple Twitter accounts, each one embodying a distinct persona with its own unique quirks and characteristics. One account was a sassy, witty commentator who thrived on sarcasm; another was a fanatical devotee who hung on her every word, showering her with exaggerated praise. I even crafted an account for an outlandish character who offered bizarre and unsolicited advice, hoping to inject chaos into her carefully curated world. I created mirror images of some of her slaves accounts in an effort to make them uneasy as well. I was trying to create some chaos in her carefully created world of control.
With each tweet, I felt a rush of exhilaration and defiance, as if I were pulling off the ultimate heist. My responses to her posts were laced with mischief. I could tell from the silence that enveloped her usual crowd that she was beginning to notice the disturbance I was creating. The volume of my tweets was impossible to ignore, and I could only imagine her growing frustration as the flood of different accounts surged through her notifications. It was a digital storm, a rebellion brewing within her own kingdom.
Days rolled by each one filled with the thrill of my revolt. I delighted in the chaos I was sowing, aware that I was planting seeds of doubt in her mind about my willingness to continue paying her fines. I wasn’t just challenging her authority; I was sending a clear message: I was done being her puppet.
Finally, after several days of my coordinated digital storm, an email arrived from her, and a rush of adrenaline coursed through me. The subject line simply read, “Enough.” I could already sense the tension in the air, and I couldn’t help but grin. This was the moment I had been waiting for—the confrontation I had provoked.
I opened the email.
“Jake,” it began, her tone sharp as a blade, “Jake, this is going to blow up in your face in the worst way. If I were you, I would dread every single phone call, every single email, every single weird look anyone shoots you. If you want to play games with me, I’ll play games with you. I love playing games, but only the ones I win of course.”
Her words were fierce, dripping with venom. I imagined her pacing her lavish apartment, lips curled in a sneering smirk as she drafted the message, her fingers flying across her phone screen. In my mind’s eye, I saw her, eyes narrowing at the screen, her frustration morphing into a twisted thrill. “I know your dad has a pretty high tolerance for you even though you’re an idiot, but he’s about to lose that last, hopeful little shred of respect he is clinging to.  What a shame.”
The adrenaline surged as I read her message. I was intoxicated by the rebellion coursing through my veins. I finally felt like I had regained some power and control in the dynamic. With a smirk of my own, I began to draft my response, eager to continue this cat-and-mouse game on my terms. The power dynamic was shifting, and I was determined to tip the scales in my favor, one tweet at a time.
But in that moment of adrenaline-fueled bravado, a creeping realization began to seep into my consciousness. I had been channeling Heath Ledger’s Joker from “The Dark Knight,” reveling in chaos and disturbing the balance of everyone mindlessly following the whims of a sociopath. The thrill of rebellion had transformed into something darker, and a gnawing doubt lodged itself in the pit of my stomach. “Had I gone too far?” I wondered.
The thought lingered. I decided that I would stop my games. Hopefully she had learned her lesson.
I knew I couldn’t delete my Twitter account—I needed her to see that I wasn’t afraid. But the reckless abandon that had fueled my rebellion began to fade replaced by a cautious rationality. I wouldn’t tag her in tweets or mention her anymore. 
“Fuck her,” I thought, a mix of defiance and regret swirling within me. I shut my laptop, staring blankly at the wall as a storm brewed inside me. The line between chaos and sanity had blurred, and now, I had to navigate a path back to solid ground. I had awakened a force I couldn’t easily contain.
I was seething with anger at my own naivety believing that I ever meant anything to her more than my money. I felt utterly used, and the desire for a taste of revenge simmered just beneath the surface. The first time you’re played like that, it leaves you feeling disgustingly gross. 
I couldn’t get her email out of my head. While I didn’t believe she was crazy enough to take drastic actions, I couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that she commanded an army of devoted slaves scattered across the United States—men who would likely murder me at her whim. She possessed a power that felt almost supernatural, as if she were a goddess wielding dark magic. I had witnessed police officers visiting her hotels in full uniform, only to see them down on their backs moments later, her feet pressed into their mouths as she called them her little bitches.
Who knew the extent of her network? How far it could stretch? She was a demonic force, leading a real-life cult of men who would do anything for her. She was the puppet master.
As I pondered my predicament, I realized that just because I hadn’t recognized her sociopathic behavior from the start didn’t absolve her of responsibility. The legalities of our twisted relationship twisted around in my brain—threats of exposure and potential blackmail hung heavy in her emails. I suspected those tactics were illegal, but I had been the one to initiate everything. I had willingly walked into this tangled mess, hoping to find something worthwhile.
Determined not to wallow in despair, I made a conscious effort to focus on the positives of this experience. I learned just how much I could bend without breaking. Sure, I was facing some financial turmoil, but somehow, every time I thought I’d hit rock bottom, I found a way to bounce back. Craigslist had become my lifeline, a treasure trove of random jobs that kept me afloat. The distractions caused by Goddess Jessica and my newfound obsession with sociopathy dulled some of the pain I had felt from losing my mom. I no longer wished for death; instead, I needed to pick up the pieces, buckle down, and claw my way back to stability.
In a strange twist of fate, I found a sense of liberation. I was free from both Lauren and Goddess Jessica, and the prospect of seeking a new girlfriend in Philadelphia filled me with a sense of hope. Serving Goddess Jessica had pushed me into the best shape of my life; I had always tried to impress her, but now I realized I could channel that energy into self-improvement.
The stress I had endured transformed into a strange sort of confidence. It was as if I had unlocked a superhero within me, a newfound strength bubbling just beneath the surface. I had never felt so self-assured, and it felt exhilarating. With every challenge I faced, I grew more resilient, more determined to carve out a new chapter for myself. The shadows of my past began to recede, replaced by the bright possibility of what lay ahead.
Thanksgiving break of 2014 was just around the corner, and I was excited at the thought of heading back home to Rockford, Illinois. I was eager to see my sister, who would be waiting for me, and my dad would be joining us as well. It felt like the perfect opportunity to reconnect with family and catch up with old friends. One friend in particular, Steven, who I hadn’t seen since high school in 2006, wanted to meet up and hit the bars. Back then, I had taken a brief detour through college after a little legal mishap—a DUI during my first summer back in my hometown—which prompted me to stay closer to home to spend more time with my mom before her multiple sclerosis worsened. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made; she cherished having me nearby.
The night before my flight back to Illinois for Thanksgiving, I had gone out with Laura and a few of her friends, hopping between a couple of bars in Center City. The next morning, I woke up with my head pounding like a jackhammer, memories of the night fading in and out. I vaguely recalled throwing up at the last bar we visited before hailing a cab home. As I groggily assessed my situation, I realized that my clothes were still on—but soaked in urine. I fished my phone out of my pocket, grimacing at the state of it. A quick glance at the time revealed it was already 11:05 AM and snow was gently falling outside. My flight was scheduled for 1:00 PM, and I was nowhere near ready.
I quickly stripped off my piss-soaked clothes, jumped in the shower, and slipped into a fresh outfit for the flight. However, a new problem emerged: my boarding pass was on my broken iPhone, which had succumbed to my piss. I chuckled to myself, “I wonder how many people have ever broken their phone by pissing their pants.” It was a morbid sense of humor that offered a fleeting distraction from the chaos around me.
 “I’m screwed,” I thought, throwing clothes into my suitcase in a panic. In a moment of inspiration, I called the help desk for my ASU email with my work phone, and they worked their magic, restoring my access. I quickly adjusted my preferences with the airline, enabling me to print a boarding pass at the airport, then called a cab.
To my surprise, security at the airport wasn’t too bad, and I made it to my gate about an hour before my flight. Needing to calm my nerves, I swung by the airport bar near my gate and chugged down a couple of Blue Moons in quick succession, hoping it would ease my flight and smooth out the rough edges of the morning. Around 12:40 PM, I finally boarded the plane, ready for the journey back to Illinois and excited to embrace the warmth of family.
I arrived around 3:00 PM, greeted by the familiar sight of my bags tumbling onto the carousel. My sister had driven up to pick me up, and my dad was already there, his face lighting up as he spotted me. We shared big hugs outside the airport, a warmth spreading through me that made me forget about the chaos of the morning. We hopped into their car and headed toward my sister’s house in Rockford.
On the way, we stopped at my favorite restaurant, Steak ‘n Shake, for some burgers. The food brought back a flood of nostalgic memories, and it felt like a comforting embrace. After finishing our meal, we continued the drive to my sister’s place, arriving around 5:30 PM. The kitchen buzzed with warmth as we gathered and shared stories, her husband joining in on the conversation. Their two dogs bounded around excitedly, showing off their playful antics as we caught up with one another.
As the evening wore on, I noticed everyone starting to wind down around 8:00 PM. But for me, this was my vacation, and I wasn’t ready to call it a night just yet. I pulled out my phone and started Googling the bars in my hometown. This was my first visit since turning 21, and the prospect of reconnecting with old friends and familiar faces I hadn’t seen in a decade had me excited. I was ready to dive back into the vibrant nightlife of Rockford, eager to see what awaited me at the bars.
Our town was one of those classic American places where most people grow up, venture off to college for a spell, and then inevitably find their way back to live out the rest of their lives. On Friday nights in the fall, the entire community would come alive, rallying around the boys' football games with a fervor that left no doubt about the hometown pride we all shared. Rockford was more than just a dot on the map; it was a small town to be proud you were from.
As I scrolled through a list of local bars, one name stood out: “Ringos.” It had echoed through my childhood, a place I’d often heard about but never visited. Curiosity piqued, I decided to stroll over and see what all the fuss was about. The walk across town took me about twenty minutes, my anticipation growing with every step. When I finally pushed open the door to Ringos, the atmosphere buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses, and the bartender immediately recognized me.
“Jake! Is that you?” Jason, a guy who had been a senior when I was just a freshman, greeted me with a broad grin. We quickly slipped into a nostalgic conversation, reminiscing about that infamous day in gym class when he had playfully shoved me while I was taking a leak, resulting in me pissing all over my gym shorts. We both erupted into laughter, and he offered a light-hearted apology. No hard feelings, just a shared chuckle over our youthful mischief.
As I settled in, I spotted a few familiar faces from high school scattered around the bar. We caught up, swapping stories about the years that had passed since graduation. They informed me that tomorrow night would be the big outing in town—the night before Thanksgiving Day—when everyone would head to Pub 12 downtown. I learned that one of the town's legendary football heroes had purchased the building and transformed it into a popular bar. It was just a short stroll away.
Among the chatter, I remembered the triplet girls from high school, and I was thrilled to find out that my two favorites were in town and wanted to join me at the bar. I sent them a message, letting them know what time I planned to arrive. I also hopped onto Facebook, hoping to rally some other friends to come out. “Hey, everyone! I’m headed to Pub 12 tomorrow night. Should be there around 9:00 PM if anyone wants to join!”
The next day, Thanksgiving Eve, my sister, dad, and her husband were bustling around the house, preparing for the big dinner the following day. Their plans for the evening consisted of a cozy night in, but I was determined to paint the town red. As the clock inched closer I began my walk to Pub 12 around 8:30 PM. My phone's GPS indicated I'd arrive around 8:50 PM, and I felt a thrill of anticipation.
I had dressed to impress, donning my sharpest attire that accentuated my physique. Unlike my high school days, when I had struggled with self-confidence and body image, I was now lean and muscular, ready to show off the hard work I had put into my fitness. I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement at the thought of possibly drumming up some interest from the girls who had previously overlooked me. 
We all had an unforgettable night that felt like something out of a movie. I ran into a hundred familiar faces—friends from high school and acquaintances I hadn’t seen in over a decade. The energy in the air was electric as we shared stories and laughter, each of us marveling at how life had shaped us. Everyone was impressed by my transformation; it felt good to bask in their compliments and reminisce about our shared past.
To my surprise, the night took an unexpected turn when I ended up making out with one of the triplets. We were all caught up in the excitement, and we closed the bar down until 2:00 AM, our laughter and cheers echoing through the night. I splurged and spent most of the money I had saved for the trip on rounds of drinks and shots for everyone. “It was worth it for a night like that,” I thought.
Thanksgiving with my family the next day went smoothly, but the town felt quieter after the wild festivities of the night before. My thirst for adventure was still heightened, and I found myself craving more fun, so I continued to hit the bars at night. However, as the final night approached, my funds were dwindling. I decided to ask my sister for a ride to the grocery store to grab some beers instead. That evening, I plopped down on the couch, settled in with a few cold ones, and switched on the TV.
As the alcohol flowed, I found myself scrolling through Facebook, and to my surprise, I stumbled upon Sarah, a girl I had gone to college with. She was a year ahead of me and had dated one of the guys in my fraternity. Standing at a petite 5’3” and weighing around 110 pounds, she was a striking brunette with an air of confidence and just a hint of a mean streak. As I drunkenly perused her profile, I noticed she was active on Messenger. In a moment of boldness fueled by liquid courage, I shot her a message, asking if she would be interested in financially dominating me.
To my surprise, she responded almost immediately, curious about what that entailed. I explained that it involved her humiliating me and assigning me embarrassing tasks in exchange for weekly payments. With a playful sense of adventure, she agreed to give it a try, and I promptly sent her $50 to kick things off. I mentioned that I was out of town but invited her to come up with some humiliating tasks for me to tackle upon my return to Philadelphia. She quickly replied, requesting a video of me sitting on the ground and sucking my thumb like a baby. “Easy peasy,” I typed back, grinning at the absurdity of it all.
After my trip to Rockford, I found myself heading to Washington, D.C. more frequently to visit Zack and, of course, to meet new girls. Having recently hit my quarterly bonus numbers, which netted me a little over $4,000, I had extra cash to spend on my adventures. One evening, we stumbled upon a massive bar crawl packed with girls, and I boldly approached their table to make new friends.
The night was a blast as we mingled and laughed with that lively group. Zack ended up meeting a roommate named Jose from their circle, who seamlessly integrated us into their parties. It was a breath of fresh air to have more people to hang out with during our trips to Washington, D.C. While we were still busy getting Zack laid regularly, I found myself enjoying the playful banter and just feeling alive again. 
I was always on the lookout for new girls who could excel at humiliating me, and since Sam had worked out well from Cue Club, I figured I’d give Lindsey a shot. One hungover morning, as I drove through my sales territory, I found myself scrolling through her pictures on Facebook. I noticed she was active on Messenger and decided to take a bold step.
“Hey Lindsey! Hope you’re doing well. I’m into financial domination, where a girl takes money from me to humiliate me and make me perform degrading tasks. Would you be interested?”
To my surprise, she replied quickly, asking, “How much would it be?”
I considered my options, and her striking looks only fueled my excitement. I had some extra bonus cash burning a hole in my pocket, so I typed back, “How about $800 to start and then $75 a week after that for you to continue to dominate me, give me humiliating tasks, and degrade me by calling me your little bitch?”
Her response was swift: “OK, that’s fine, but I want the $800 now.”
I asked for her PayPal details, and she provided them without hesitation. My heart raced as I pulled up the app and sent the $800—it was the most I had ever transferred in one go. The thrill of it all had me so turned on that I had to cut my sales day short and drive home to masturbate, fantasizing about how hot she was.
Even though our interactions in Philadelphia were sporadic, I kept the payments flowing. The money I sent her went to a good cause too—she ended up getting a boob job, and when I saw her new photos, she looked even hotter than before.
In December, Zack came to visit me in Philadelphia, and we decided to hit Xfinity Live, the bustling hub and spoke bar complex situated right by the stadiums in South Philly. The place was packed and it was freezing outside. We nearly got turned away because they were nearing capacity. Once inside, we made our way to the main area, where the atmosphere was electric. Fans jostled for space shoulder to shoulder, and cheerleaders were leading chants, making the most of the excitement of the away game.
Looking for a breather, we slipped into a bar tucked away from the main crowd—a cozy burger joint. It was still busy but it wasn’t as crazy as the main area was. We ordered a couple of shots and beers. It didn’t take long for us to find an unoccupied bench, and we hopped up to stand on it. The energy was infectious, and it was the perfect way to kick off an unforgettable night.
The bar was so packed that we probably looked like just a couple of tall guys lost in the crowd, which is why security didn’t bat an eye at us standing on the bench. Out of nowhere, two stunning girls—a cute blonde and a sultry brunette—parked right in front of us. Seizing the moment, I leaned in and tapped the blonde on the shoulder. She turned around, squinting at me with an expression that hinted she might punch me in the face. I quickly blurted out, “Hey, have you met my friend Zack? He went to Harvard!”
That was all it took. Zack gave me a playful shove and laughed, “Jesus Christ, Jake,” but I could tell he approved. It was a classic line that had never failed me, and this girl was definitely a catch. Her name was Mary, and she, along with her equally cute brunette friend, turned out to be from Philadelphia as well. We spent the rest of the night hanging out, reveling in each other's company.
Somewhere along the line, we blacked out from the endless stream of drinks, but it was clear we had an unforgettable time. The next morning, however, we woke up feeling like we’d been hit by a freight train, and Zack needed a ride to the train station.
Both of us were wrecked, probably still buzzing from the night before. Zack made it to my front door first, but as soon as he stepped outside, he hit a thin sheet of invisible ice and went tumbling down all four steps. I hadn’t laughed that hard since before my mom died.
Determined not to follow in his clumsy footsteps, I grasped the railing tightly before stepping out onto the icy concrete. But as soon as my right foot touched the ice, it slipped out from under me. I lost my balance and fell forward, crashing down the stairs right next to him.
We lay there for a minute, groaning in pain and laughter, before we finally managed to crawl to our knees and get back on our feet. Zack had figured out a shimmy method that seemed to work well for making progress toward the car, so I mimicked him. It took us a good five minutes to shimmy about 300 feet to where the car was parked, but we eventually made it. I got Zack to the train station just in time, then made my way back to my apartment.
Once home, I realized I needed a lot more sleep to survive the hangover. But first, I decided to indulge myself a little. I remembered a hot friend of Lauren’s named Sovy. She was a sexy 5’3” Asian with curves to die for: giant fake boobs, a perfect ass, and a flat stomach that made my mouth water. She always had a bit of a sassy edge, so I sent her a casual message saying, “Hey, what’s up?”
She replied, “Not much. Just partying and living life. YOLO.” Damn, she was so hot. My fingers danced over the keyboard as I typed out, “Hey, if you’re interested in having a money slave, I’d do $100 a week and be your little bitch, doing whatever you say.”
I saw that she read my message, the dreaded “…” appearing as she started typing back. My heart raced, and my hand stroked my cock faster in anticipation. I was rock hard, waiting for her response. Finally, it came: “OK, I’m down with that, bitch boy. Send me the $100 now.”
Without hesitation, I followed her instructions, excitement coursing through me. The thrill of having this sexy little Asian calling me “bitch boy” within minutes of asking was electrifying. “Maybe this could be a good replacement for Goddess Jessica,” I thought.
She messaged me that she’d have instructions for some tasks she wanted me to complete soon. My excitement was building, and I couldn't help but confess, “Just so you know, I’m really into hot girls making me do things like shoving stuff up my ass and eating my own cum, along with other humiliating tasks.”
“Noted,” she replied. My imagination ran wild, and I exploded while gazing at a picture of her in a bikini, picturing myself on my knees right in front of her. That sexy stomach had me hooked instantly. I knew this girl was going to mess with my mind in all the right ways. But I also felt smarter now that I had some experience under my belt from serving a sociopathic Pro Dominatrix.
A couple of days later, Sarah asked where her video was of me sucking on my thumb while kneeling on the ground. I responded, explaining that I was accustomed to harsher tasks but was willing to do the task for her. “Like what kind of harsher tasks?” she asked. It felt like the perfect opportunity to share what truly turned me on. I recounted a time when another girl had made me kneel in a closet while she fucked her boyfriend. To my surprise, Sarah immediately expressed interest in doing something similar—for a little extra cash.
We settled on an additional $50, and she informed me that her boyfriend would be home in an hour or two. She wanted me to videotape myself on my knees, sucking on a doorknob like it was a dick while they had sex. The thought of it sent shivers down my spine, and I was getting a boner.
Determined to edge myself until she was ready, I waited and just looked at pictures of how hot she was. About an hour and a half later, I received a Facebook message: “OK, little bitch. We’re getting ready to fuck right now. Start sucking.”
I walked over to my bedroom door, got down on my knees, and took the doorknob in my mouth. It felt bigger and harder than I remembered. With my phone in one hand, I was still throbbing from edging and teasing myself with thoughts of her commanding me to perform this degrading task while she got railed. After about twenty minutes, she messaged me again. I had taken a couple of breaks from sucking the doorknob because my jaw was aching, but I kept my mouth on it for the majority of the time.
She let me know they were done, but apparently, she hadn’t fully enjoyed it. I guess she was too preoccupied with the thought of me sucking a doorknob while they were fucking to fully enjoy the sex. I told her I appreciated the task and sent her the $50 along with the video of me sucking on the doorknob for good measure. She couldn’t help but make fun of me for it.
After that, I laid down on my bed and came to some pictures of her from college. She had also become a fitness trainer, so there were plenty of sizzling shots of her showcasing that sexy stomach. I imagined her grinding on his cock, her hips moving tantalizingly while I knelt there, her little cuckold bitch boy.
We continued our playful exchanges for a few more weeks, with her making me eat dog food on video, but I quickly realized her tasks and humiliations weren’t extreme enough to satisfy my cravings. We agreed to part ways amicably, both knowing it was for the best.
One night, in a moment of weakness fueled by alcohol, I shot Lindsey a message, asking if she would make me get a tattoo that read “Lindsey [her last name]’s Little Bitch” on my ass. To my surprise, she instantly agreed, finding it hilarious that she could show off my permanent label to her friends and the guys she was hooking up with. The thought of being permanently branded as her bitch turned me on in ways I hadn’t expected.
Nervously, I scheduled the tattoo appointment and explained to the artist what I wanted written. When he asked why I was getting it, I simply told him I had lost a sports bet with her and that she was a good friend. He raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical, but he dropped the subject and got to work. The tattoo was set for a few days later, and I arrived on time, my heart racing with anticipation.
Let me tell you, ass tattoos must be the most painful places to ink. The tattoo artist kept urging me to relax. He let me know that he had an ass tattoo also and knew it was the most painful spot to get tattooed but that he wouldn’t be able to keep the lines straight if I didn’t find a way to stabilize my body. Ten minutes into the session, I discovered that if I flexed my ass, I could minimize the spasms, giving him a better canvas to work with. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he announced he was finished and asked if I wanted to see it. “Nah, I’ll just check it out later,” I replied, and he covered it in Saran wrap. I was officially branded as her little bitch for eternity.
Surprisingly, the actual feeling of humiliation didn’t quite match the excitement I’d felt while fantasizing about it beforehand, but I didn’t hate it. Lindsey was thrilled and immediately asked for a picture to show all her friends. It was clear she enjoyed the control she had over me.
A few days after Zack and I met Mary at Xfinity Live, Mary texted Zack, inviting him back to Philadelphia for a visit. He agreed, and she picked him up from the train station. I ended up playing the third wheel in their little reunion. They hit it off again. I had met a stunning black girl named Noelle a couple weeks prior who I was hanging out with as well. I decided to invite her to join us.
Noelle was a striking 5’3” black queen, her milky ebony skin glowing and her dazzling white teeth making her smile unforgettable. With a face that could grace the covers of magazines and a physique that was nothing short of mesmerizing, she was an absolute knockout. We had hit the gym together a few times, where she pushed me to my limits, leaving me breathless. With her super tight ass, long, sexy legs, and a great sense of humor that matched my own, I would’ve been more than happy to let her take the reins and treat me like her devoted little bitch. Since we’d met about a month ago, our chemistry had sparked something, and we found ourselves hanging out a few times a week, and I think we both thought it might develop into a relationship.
I texted her to see if she wanted to join me, Max, and Mary and me for a night out. "Of course!" she replied eagerly. We all headed to a bar called BRU in Center City Philadelphia. At the time, I was diving a little too deep into my alcohol intake, and as the day progressed, I got progressively drunk until I reached the point of blackout. Somewhere in my haze, I must have said something to Noelle that struck a nerve because the next thing I knew, I was being kicked out of the bar for being too intoxicated. I think we made quite the scene.
Later, I learned from Zack that he had run into Noelle at the bar after our escapade, and apparently, she was very upset. He speculated that I might have called her “the N-word,” but I was incredulous—there was no way I could have done that. That word wasn’t even in my vocabulary.
That night, after somehow managing to stumble home, I fell into a restless sleep filled with vivid dreams. In one particularly unsettling dream, Goddess Jessica appeared in my room, conducting some sort of bizarre experiment or uploading information directly into my brain. I woke up in a cold sweat, the intensity of the dream still lingering, and I glanced around my room, half-expecting to see her standing there. But she was nowhere to be found, so I reluctantly drifted back to sleep.
The next morning, I was jolted awake by Zack’s request for a ride to the train station. With a groan, I crawled out of bed, nursing a hangover that felt like a freight train had run me over. I grabbed the keys to my car, and we shuffled down to the parking lot, both feeling the weight of the previous night. Thankfully, we made it to the train station in one piece, and as Zack hopped out, we made plans to hang out again in a couple of weeks, hoping this time we could avoid any drama.
Chapter 3 – Replacing the Void
I found myself fully committed to Sovy, entering into a year-long contract of financial servitude, with weekly payments of $100 in exchange for a deliciously humiliating experience. Ever since Lauren first introduced us a few years ago, I had harbored a crush on her, and the fact that she and Lauren knew each other added an extra layer of appeal. It was even hotter that they seemed to be in a bit of a spat, which likely fueled Sovy’s desire to dominate me, her friend’s ex-boyfriend, in a cheeky twist of fate.
Sovy quickly grasped the art of humiliation, and soon enough, I found myself engaging in degrading tasks like shoving various objects up my ass, eating my own cum when I was finally allowed to cum for her, and sucking dildos as if they were real cocks. Each session felt like a new descent into depravity.
She excelled at verbal domination, never hesitating to remind me that I was her little bitch—not the other way around. On one occasion, I got a bit too mouthy, and in a flash she screenshot the video of me sucking a dildo, threatening to send it to my father if I didn’t curb my attitude. She was far more interactive and engaging than Goddess Jessica, and I couldn’t help but think that she would’ve made a fantastic Professional Financial Dominatrix.
As the weeks passed, I kept the play going strong during my first few months back in Phoenix, but there was still much to unfold in my story.
I managed to keep my head above water at my job in Philadelphia. I missed my friends back in Arizona, but the salary was decent enough to ease the ache of loneliness. I found myself constantly drawn to new girls from my personal life who had an interest in financially dominating me, feeding my insatiable appetite for fresh hotties to fantasize about. However, a shake-up in management was on the horizon: my boss, Rajesh, was being promoted to a position in the corporate office on the East Coast. I thought this might relieve some pressure, especially since I was on probation for not hitting sales numbers for a couple of quarters. Rajesh assured me that all I needed to do was explain to our new manager, John, how hard we had been working together to turn things around, and everything would be fine.
During this time, I started enjoying solo outings. I found it exhilarating to make new friends at various bars, and I had a better ability to attract girls than I ever had before. Though Noelle and I had patched things up, it seemed our friendship would never fully recover after that fateful night I had ruined. I never asked her what I’d done to upset her; instead, I simply expressed my regrets, telling her I was really drunk and apologizing for whatever I might have said. She claimed to have forgiven me but didn’t want to relive the past, leaving me in the dark about the specifics.
Zack, on the other hand, was spending more time alone with Mary, which meant I wasn’t hanging out with him as much either. My nights out often consisted of tagging along with Hayley and her friends, joining Jeff to watch sports at a bar, or heading out to bars solo and causing a ruckus wherever I went. I was becoming a bit of a maniac, creating chaos in every venue I visited, convinced I was simply having a blast while living it up. However, I quickly realized that my drinking had escalated; I was blacking out at least a few times a week, and the thrill of the same old routine was beginning to bore me.
In a moment of weakness, I decided to reach out to Goddess Jessica. “Hey, I’m sorry for everything that happened,” I typed, my fingers trembling with anticipation. “I know I acted like a crazy person, and I sincerely apologize. If you would ever consider letting me serve you again, please let me know.”
She messaged me back, firmly stating she would never allow me to serve her again due to all the stress I had caused her. I understood her position, but it stung. I could feel the familiar feelings of depression creeping back in, reminiscent of the dark days following my mom's death. Despite my best efforts to stay positive, to go out and meet new people, I sensed a deep void inside me that was impossible to fill. As the darkness enveloped me, thoughts of suicide flickered in my mind once more. I knew I needed a change.
December arrived, bringing with it a lull for the holidays. Determined to shake off the gloom, I decided to embrace the chaos during the break. With the relief of no longer answering to Rakesh as my manager, my confidence soared. Jeff and I hit the bars nearly every night leading up to Christmas and New Year's. Always on the prowl for new connections, Jeff, despite being in his mid-forties, was a handsome guy with the charm to engage anyone.
He informed me that some of his high school friends were gathering at a bar called Urban Saloon on Saturday, January 2nd, and we planned to make a night of it. That night, I had a fantastic time meeting his old friends.
The night took a wild turn when I blacked out from the booze and ended up in a scuffle with a random guy at the bar. A punch landed squarely on my eyebrow, splitting it open and sending blood cascading down my face. I stumbled outside, where a bouncer handed me a cloth to staunch the bleeding and informed me I wouldn't be allowed back in.
When I woke up the next day, my face was glued to my pillowcase by dried blood. I had work the less than 24 hours later —my first day under a new boss—and there was no hiding the mess I had made of my face. The cut looked horrific, and I sported a dark black eye on the left side. I chuckled to myself, thinking about how I would explain my appearance.
It was a Sunday, and the Eagles were playing their last regular-season game, so I decided to head to Xfinity Live to catch the action. I rode the subway down by myself, feeling the need for more excitement after the chaos of the break. The bars buzzed with energy for the game, and I ducked into PBR, a Western-themed bar known for its attractive bartenders—dubbed "Buckle Bunnies"—who would ride the mechanical bull at the center of the room.
I mingled with a couple of girls at the bar, buying shots and enjoying the atmosphere. As the night wore on, I glanced at my phone and realized it was already past 11:00 PM. With a meeting scheduled for 8:00 AM the next morning to meet my new boss, I reluctantly said my goodbyes and hopped on the train back home.
Arriving at my place around 11:45 PM, I checked my Facebook Messenger and noticed a girl named Justine online. I had always thought she was incredibly sexy back in college, and a spark of intrigue flickered within me.
Justine stood about 5'5" tall, with lustrous brown hair cascading over a super-hot body that turned heads. I had encountered her at a few of my college roommate's parties, and she had always exuded an air of confidence that hinted at a mean streak lurking beneath her stunning exterior. Spotting her active and online on Messenger, I couldn’t resist the urge to reach out and ask if she might be interested in financially dominating me. Her response was swift: “You need to find Jesus.”
A rush of embarrassment washed over me, but I quickly apologized and admitted that she was just too hot for me to resist. Intrigued, she kept the conversation going, asking questions about what financial domination entailed. After about twenty minutes of catching up on each other's lives, she surprised me by agreeing to give it a try. We settled on $50 a week—a modest amount, but I was juggling so many new experiences with different girls that I had to keep the weekly payments manageable.
The next morning, I woke to a phone call on my work phone. Glancing at the clock, I saw it was 8:30 AM. “Shit,” I thought as I picked up the receiver. It was another Mike from my Philadelphia office. “Dude, where are you? We’re all waiting for you in the office. It’s John’s first day, so this isn’t a good look, man.”
“I know, man. I should be there in about 25 minutes,” I replied, leaping out of bed and racing through the shower. As I looked in the mirror, I was greeted by the horrifying sight of my face. I quickly slapped a bandage over the cut, but my eye was still a swollen black mess, a clear testament to last night’s escapades.
Climbing into my car, I couldn’t help but chuckle at my reflection in the rear-view mirror. It struck me as absurd—perhaps this would be the day I pushed the envelope too far and got fired. But strangely, I didn’t care.
I pulled into the office parking lot around 9:15 AM, stepping out of my car and walking into the building. The training room was bustling with activity; everyone turned to stare as I entered. John, the new manager, was in the middle of an engaging presentation about his journey with the company and his ambitious goals for the future.
Once the meeting wrapped up, we all shuffled back to our respective offices. Mike barged into mine, his eyes wide with concern. “Dude, I don’t know what happened, and I don’t need to know, but you look awful. You have to go to John’s office right now and tell him you got mugged or something. You can’t just waltz in here an hour late looking like that with no explanation.”
He was right. With a sigh, I made my way to John’s office. “I’m really sorry for being late to the meeting,” I began, mustering as much sincerity as I could. “I got mugged over the weekend.” John was concerned obviously, and just let me know to let him know in advance if I was going to be that late again, especially if any of the executives were in town. I assured him it wouldn’t happen again and that I was okay. “Damn,” I thought, “if only he had been the manager when I first came out here.”
Just as I began to distract myself from my depression, more bad news hit me. My dad called, letting me know that my grandfather—my mom's father—was in hospice care and didn’t have much longer to live. Given their rocky relationship, I didn’t have a strong emotional reaction to the news. While I didn't wish him dead, I couldn’t easily forgive him for how he had treated my mom during her life.
After his passing, an inheritance would be on the horizon for my sister and me. Once everything—his 401k, the house sale, and his financial accounts—was sorted, my sister and I were each set to inherit around $180,000. The prospect of this got my spirits up. Surely, with $180,000 in the bank, my depression would be a thing of the past.
He passed away just a few days after my dad delivered the initial call, and my uncle wasted no time getting the 401k transferred, getting the house for sale, and dividing up the assets. It sounded like we would see the money sooner rather than later. “If I can just hold on until then,” I thought, clinging to the hope of brighter days ahead.
Meanwhile, Justine turned out to be a real gem. She was naturally submissive but seemed to genuinely enjoy our conversations. Whenever I requested tasks, she was eager to take on a dominant role for a little extra cash. She even agreed to sell me her worn panties for $100, mailing them to me in Philadelphia. They arrived a few days later, sealed in a plastic bag, and bore a telltale stain from her juices. She instructed me to create a video of myself making out with them as if I were eating her out. I complied, the intoxicating scent of her pussy pressed into my nose.
Once she was satisfied with the video, Justine demanded that I wrap the panties around my face, letting her juices touch my nose as I looked at and jacked off to pictures of her. I scrolled back through her early college photos and found one from Halloween: she donned black panties and wings, looking every bit like a dark angel—a vision fit for the pages of a Victoria’s Secret catalog. I came in mere minutes, an explosive orgasm washing over me as I imagined her calling me her little bitch and making me suck on her worn panties. Our playful exchanges continued for months; each interaction more thrilling than the last.
Then came the bachelor party in Cabo for my friend Brad from Arizona. While I wasn’t invited to the wedding—since he was marrying Lauren's twin sister, whom I had dated for a while—I was still welcomed to join the festivities in Cabo. Just before the trip, my new boss, John, notified me that the company and I would be parting ways. “Finally,” I thought, relieved. I hadn’t realized it would take so much effort to get fired. The head of HR flew in from headquarters, and during our meeting, we all agreed to a mutual separation, rather than framing it as a termination. This arrangement suited me perfectly; it meant I could present it more favorably in interviews when I moved back to Arizona.
The following weekend, I found myself in Cabo for the bachelor party. We all flew in from various corners of the United States, and by the end of it, there were 15 of us ready to celebrate. Sporting matching tank tops, we were a sight to behold. Our trip coincided with spring break for many southwestern schools, and the town was packed with 19- to 22-year-old beauties. We had rented a fishing boat for Saturday, accommodating about 12 of the attendees. On Friday morning, the boat captain called to inform us they had no other trips scheduled that day. He offered to anchor in a cove, letting us drink on the boat all afternoon. Without a second thought, we eagerly accepted; we didn’t have a plan for the day anyway.
We loaded about ten cases of beer onto the boat, along with several handles of vodka and mixers for shots. After cruising over to the cove, we parked the boat right in front of the energetic beach bars. A few of the guys took smaller taxi boats to the shore, successfully rounding up around 25 girls from various groups eager to join our floating fiesta. Once everyone was back on board, we kicked off an unforgettable party.
For about four glorious hours, we danced and blasted music, soaking up the sun with some of the hottest girls in Cabo. I felt rejuvenated. Just before the trip, I had started receiving chunks of my inheritance money, and I was ready to spend it all on making memories. With an endless supply of gorgeous company and the funds to enjoy it, life felt electrifying.
That night, we hit up the hottest club in Cabo and splurged on bottle service. Around 10:00 PM, my buddy Patrick approached me with a gleam in his eye, asking if I wanted to do shots. Always up for a good time, I followed him to one of the bars, but after all the drinks we'd had, the shot went down like a brick. I desperately signaled to the bartender for a trash can, but he didn’t get the message, and the bar was too packed for a graceful exit. So, I made the executive decision to just aim my head down and let it all out.
Mortified after hurling inside the bar, especially after getting some on my shirt, I thought about calling it a night. But Patrick wasn’t having any of it. He quickly located a merch stand and bought me a bright pink “El Squid Roe” shirt, insisting I change quickly. Miraculously, the security guards lost track of me in the chaos, and we slipped back to our friends at the back of the club.
We ended up closing the place down, having an amazing night. The energy was electric as three floors of partygoers shouted the lyrics to every hit blaring from the sound system, and the place was filled with beautiful people. Life felt vibrant and exhilarating once more.
The next day, we unanimously decided that soaking up the sun in the marina with the college kids was far more enticing than going fishing. With that, we set sail back into the cove, ready for round two of our mission to attract girls to the boat. This time, our efforts were a bit less fruitful. While we managed to snag a group of sorority girls, they didn’t quite match the stunning company we’d enjoyed the previous day. Undeterred, I committed to getting as drunk as possible.
As the day wore on, the captain asked if we wanted to head out to The Arch, a famous rock formation about two miles offshore. Intrigued, we agreed, and with just about an hour of sunlight left, we made our way there. Dropping anchor, we settled in for the last leg of our boating adventure.
About 15 minutes before we were due to head back to shore, I crawled along the side of the ship to reach the front. I was craving a cigarette but didn’t want to disturb anyone with the smoke. As I savored my quick smoke, my mind wandered to thoughts of my mom. Once I finished, I attempted to crawl back around to rejoin the group, but in the inky darkness, I lost my footing. Desperately, I grasped the handle on the edge, but I continued to slip. The pain of trying to hold on became unbearable as the bar dug into my arm, forcing me to let go.
I plummeted about eight feet into the pitch-black ocean. Strangely, I wasn’t frightened; instead, I imagined the sea lions below me, curious about the commotion, or possibly sharks drawn by the splashes. I swam around to the back of the boat, where the doorway was, and began to pound on it frantically. Time was ticking down—only 5 to 10 minutes remained before the boat would leave, and no one knew I had fallen overboard. Panic surged through me: “I’m going to get stranded out here, or worse, pulled under by the propellers when they start up!”
I kicked my legs desperately, trying to propel myself high enough to grab onto the edge, but each attempt sent me back down into the water. Realizing that wasn’t working, I pounded on the door with all my might. Just as despair began to set in, I spotted a face peering over the edge. “Thank God,” I thought. It was Andrew, our friend, who reached out and pulled me back aboard. Everyone was shocked but relieved they’d found me before it was too late. “No shit,” I thought, catching my breath.
The trip had been a blast, filled with gorgeous college girls, and I began to entertain the idea of pursuing college girls to dominate me. They would surely appreciate the money, and, let’s face it, college girls were often at the peak of their physical beauty. As I approached my late twenties, the thought of being dominated by younger women felt thrilling.
The following morning, we headed to the airport, returning to our respective cities. My lease was set to end in May, so I had about a month and a half before I would drive back to Phoenix. I planned to move in with my dad while I figured out my next steps. Before I left, I enjoyed more fun nights out in Philadelphia with Hayley, her roommates, and Jeff, cherishing the moments until my goodbye at the end of May.
I decided to make a few memorable stops on my drive back to Arizona: first, a visit to Chicago to see my friend Patrick; then a detour to Dallas to catch up with my aunts; followed by a stop in Austin to see Stephanie. From there, I planned to drive straight through to Sun City, AZ, where I would be moving in with my dad.
Chicago turned out to be somewhat lackluster, prompting me to leave after just a day and head to Rockford to visit my sister. I intended to stay for a couple of days, enjoying the company of her dogs, but we ended up squabbling over trivial matters. Frustrated, I decided to cut my visit short and move on.
The next day, I drove to Dallas, arriving at my aunts’ house late in the afternoon. We shared a few beers before calling it a night. Our conversations were peppered with talk of aliens, sparked by a story about how my uncle had seen a UFO when he was in elementary school. According to my aunt, many people, including teachers, had witnessed the sighting, lending it an air of credibility that sent a chill down my spine. As I settled into bed, I couldn’t shake the eerie feeling that extraterrestrials were watching me, but eventually, exhaustion took over, and I drifted off to sleep.
The following day was my birthday. My aunts surprised me with a delightful bundt cake, and we celebrated with a small gathering before staying up late, smoking cigarettes and chatting. With some of my inheritance money, I had purchased a camera and lens before leaving Philadelphia, so we spent some time trying to capture the night sky. Unfortunately, I quickly realized I didn’t have the right lens for astrophotography.
Tension simmered in the air as my aunts had been arguing—apparently, one of them had been unfaithful. I felt awkward being caught in the middle of their turmoil, so I decided to leave the next day to head to Austin to see Stephanie.
I got to her apartment and she came out and greeted me with her dog Teddy. She was a sight fore sore eyes and we shared a giant hug in the parking lot. We ended up going out with some of her work friends and I was a maniac buying shots for everyone all night. Eventually I grabbed the check and my card was declined. Stephanie had to cover the $400 tab for me and I assured her I would pay her back as soon as I got things sorted out with the bank which was all settled up the next day.
Later that day, I said my goodbyes and hopped back into my car to finish my drive back to Arizona.  It was a 15 hour drive back to Sun City, where my dad lived from Austin, and I tried to make it the entire way in one go. I made it about 13 hours and had to stop between Flagstaff and Sedona for a quick nap. After that I was able to make it the rest of the way and my dad greeted me happily in the front yard of his house.
Once back in Arizona, I received the remainder of my grandfather’s inheritance, and I was ready to embrace life to the fullest. Having long battled feelings of despair, I now found myself with nearly $200,000 in my bank account and zero responsibilities. I decided to start a photography business, investing around $20,000 in essential camera bodies, lenses, and lighting gear. It felt good to be back home with my dad, but living a good distance from Scottsdale—where most of my friends resided—was a bit isolating.
I continued my online play with Sovy, who had been dominating me, and I discovered a new girl named Julie. She had dated one of my college friends and was open to letting me be her little bitch for $100 a week, plus I’d buy her lingerie to wear while having sex with her boyfriend. We struck a deal: each time she slept with him, she would message me to humiliate me. I owed her $25 for each encounter, and if I took longer than five minutes to send it, that would jump to $50. The moment I received her texts about her sexual exploits, a rush of blood surged to my head and coursed through my body. The thought of another guy inside her sexy body while she teased me was intoxicating.
Sovy had also ramped up the humiliation, making me perform increasingly degrading tasks. I found myself sticking pencils up my ass and declaring that I was her bitch on video. Hot Cheetos joined the lineup of humiliations, but the worst came during a moment of weakness when I suggested that it would be thrilling if she made me eat my own shit. “What could be more disgusting or humiliating than that?” I thought, convinced it would be the ultimate act of degradation.
After a few drinks, I messaged her: “Please force me to eat my own shit, Goddess. You’ll own me forever if you have that video as blackmail leverage.” Her response was chilling: “Fine, eat your own shit and send me a video tonight, or I’ll show your dad all the other humiliating things you’ve done for me.” She followed up with a video of me sucking off a dildo, a potent reminder of the leverage she held over me.
At this point, I was struggling to have solid bowel movements, so I made a pit stop at the gas station to grab a banana, hoping it would do the trick and help me out. “Usually she made me stick bananas up my ass so this is a new use case,” I chuckled to myself. The thought of needing to rely on a humble fruit for such a personal issue felt oddly amusing, yet strangely necessary.  I felt a wave of humiliation wash over me as I wrestled with the bizarre notion of doing something so degrading just to please her. Yet, there was a dark thrill in that very humiliation—a twisted craving that surged through me. The thought of being able to gaze at her alluring stomach, knowing she had made me eat my own shit, sent shivers down my spine. 
I arrived home, my heart pounding with anticipation, and after about thirty minutes, I sensed the urge to take a shit. I hurried to the bathroom and settled onto the toilet letting nature take its course, I wiped and glanced down at the result. It wasn't exactly solid, but it certainly wasn't a complete mess either—somewhere in that awkward in-between state that left me pondering my next move. “It’ll work,” I convinced myself. I opened my phone camera and pointed it at the toilet, capturing the moment of humiliation for her. With a fork in hand, I plunged it into the murky depths, retrieving a piece from the bottom. As I raised the fork to my face, a wave of revulsion washed over me, but I pushed through. I opened my mouth wide, inserted the fork, and clamped down, fighting back the gag reflex that threatened to rise. The taste was muted, an unsettling reminder of what I was doing, but the thought of her revealing my secret to my dad if I didn’t follow through drove me onward.  I swallowed in the video and then immediately cut it off.  I started to stroke my dick to get the courage up to send her the video.  I was so horny looking at pictures of her, and I finally got the courage to press send.  I could see that she had seen the video and was probably in the process of watching the it.  I continued to stroke.  She finally responded, “Nice work little bitch.”  I stroked faster staring at her sexy stomach and finally came in an explosive orgasm.  She fucking owned me.
A few weeks after the grotesque episode, Sovy unexpectedly blocked me. Perhaps she was too repulsed by what I had done, or maybe our twisted dynamic had spiraled out of control. Regardless, I had saved all her photos, allowing me to relive the memories of our outrageous encounters whenever I desired. I realized it was time to seek new conquests. Finding girls had never been a challenge for me, after all.
Marly and Ian, my old roommates from Philadelphia, had booked trip to Las Vegas. We had been keeping in touch, and they knew I was back in Phoenix, making it an easy drive for me to join in on the fun. In hindsight, that might have been the last place on Earth I should have chosen to go. I should have been focused on figuring out my life and planning my next steps, but with nearly $100,000 sitting in my bank account, the appeal of partying with them for the weekend was too hard to pass up. I was already drinking every night, and with a free place to crash, how much could I possibly spend in just one weekend.
However, there was a little snag in my plans. After Sovy had stopped dominating me, I found myself with a gaping void that needed to be filled. Julie, too, was growing increasingly reluctant to continue our dynamic. I suspected she realized just how much I had sexualized our interactions and began to feel repulsed by the thought of me masturbating to it. Our weekly $100 exchanges had decreased since she hardly messaged me anymore, although we would still engage sporadically when she felt like it.
In a moment of desperation, I decided to take a leap of faith. Hayley’s roommate, Laura, was stunning and exuded an air of sociopathy that intrigued me. I reached out to her on Facebook, saying, “Hey, if you’d ever be interested in financially dominating me, I’d be down.” To my surprise, she replied that she was hesitant because she might get too wrapped up in it. “Perfect,” I responded, laughing along with her. She wanted to mull it over a bit before committing and asked for more details. I told her I’d start with a $1,000 payment, followed by $100 a week for updates on her hookups and to make me perform humiliating tasks like eating my own cum or wearing women’s lingerie.
She requested some time to think it over, and I assured her she could take as long as she needed. The next day, she messaged me, wanting to give it a try. It seemed she really wanted that $1,000. I still had plenty of cash, and the thought of being humiliated by her thrilled me. We were friends, but now we were about to embark on a completely different dynamic where she would hold the reins.
I promptly sent over the $1,000, and she wasted no time in asking for a video of me cumming on my own face, along with my dad’s phone number for potential blackmail leverage. “Wow, she’s really diving in headfirst,” I thought, sensing an almost instinctual confidence in her approach. She agreed to a year-long commitment with no buyout, meaning I was bound to fulfill every humiliating task she devised.
With a new Dominatrix in my life, I set off to Las Vegas to reunite with Marly and Ian. The drive was filled with anticipation, and upon arriving, I met up with them at their hotel. That weekend turned out to be sweltering, and surprisingly, they weren’t really in the mood to party. Instead, we found ourselves drifting into our own separate worlds. I indulged in drinks and the thrill of being surrounded by stunning girls, while they lounged by the pool and explored the sights. It was a fine arrangement; we simply had different interests.
On the final day, boredom and horniness collided within me. I decided to message Laura, my new Dominatrix, and asked if she had any humiliating tasks in mind for me. She hadn’t been particularly demanding lately, so I added a little incentive: if she pushed me into some truly embarrassing antics, I’d send her $1,000. She made me promise, and then gave me my first task: jerk off onto the ground and lick it up on camera. Her threat hung in the air like a cloud; if I didn’t comply, she’d send my dad the last video of me jacking off onto my own face, and I had no doubt she would follow through. Our friendship had vanished, replaced by a dynamic where she viewed me solely as her submissive plaything. There was something undeniably sexy about this shift, and I quickly pulled up her pictures on Facebook to fuel my arousal.
It didn’t take long for desire to take over, and soon I found myself on my knees, vigorously stroking my cock to her enticing images. With determination, I opened Venmo, typed in her name, and entered the amount—$1,000. As I continued to pleasure myself, just before I reached the edge of orgasm, I hit the send button, and a wave of hot embarrassment washed over me. I recorded a video, and in an explosive moment, I came all over the hotel bathroom floor. Reality hit hard; I now had to lick it up for her as well. I adjusted my phone, positioning it to capture the pile of cum, then bent down so my face was inches from it and started lapping it up. I sent her the video, breathless. She responded with a simple yet commanding message: “Good, bitch. Now just wait for further instructions.”
But those instructions didn’t arrive quickly. The next morning, we needed to check out of the hotel, and I was still feeling the effects of last night’s drinking spree, having spent hours in the lobby until around 6:00 AM. We checked out at 10:00 AM, and I was still plastered. Realizing I had parked in the hotel garage, I climbed into my car only to realize I was in no shape to drive. I cranked up the AC, reclined my seat, shut my eyes, and passed out.
Around 2:00 PM, I was jolted awake by persistent tapping on my window. Startled, I saw a bike security officer informing me that sleeping in the parking garage wasn’t allowed. If I wasn’t a hotel guest, I’d need to leave. Panic washed over me at the thought of the police getting involved, so I complied and hit the road. I was in desperate need of food, so I swung by a nearby fast-food joint. Parched and disoriented, I kept driving toward home, battling the urge to doze off.
It felt like a grueling journey; the fatigue was overwhelming. Finally, just 30 minutes from home, I began recognizing familiar streets and neighborhoods, a wave of relief washing over me. “I’m going to make it,” I thought, bolstered by the thought of home.
When I finally rolled back into Sun City, the first thing I did was park my car, crawl into bed, and pull up sultry pictures of Laura and Julie to get myself off. I still had two gorgeous women who regularly indulged in humiliating me, but Laura was becoming progressively more demanding. So, I decided to message Julie, throwing out an enticing offer: “Hey, I’d be willing to pay $500 to come clean you and your boyfriend’s apartment.” She responded that we could do that but mentioned she needed to figure out a day when he wouldn’t be home.
I pushed my luck further. “Any chance you’d make me get on my knees when I arrive, put a dog collar on me, and duct tape one of your dirty socks into my mouth, making me keep it there while I clean?” I could see her typing, anticipation electrifying the air. “Yep. I can do that,” she replied. “Fuck, that’s so nasty and sexy,” I thought, my arousal escalating as I began stroking faster to her photos. The images of her with him fueled my desire even more; the idea of her having a long-term boyfriend while still degrading me was an irresistible turn-on.
Just as I neared the edge of orgasm, I had one more daring request brewing. I typed out, “If I pay more, would you be willing to make me eat your boyfriend's cum out of one of your used condoms?” She quickly shot back, “Uh, we don’t use condoms.” Undeterred, I saw a glimmer of opportunity and replied, “What about making me lick the creampie out of your panties?” She drew the line, declaring that was too far. I understood and quickly reassured her, “That’s fine. Forget about it; we can just stick to the other things.” She agreed, saying, “Fine, let me figure out when a good day is.” I replied, “No problem.”
I found myself climaxing to the thought of cleaning her apartment, entirely consumed by how hot she was.
The next day, she messaged me that her boyfriend would be at work the following day, and I could come by to clean starting at 1:00 PM. I let her know I’d bring a dog collar and swing by. “OK,” she replied.
That night, I drank heavily and must’ve masturbated five times, my mind racing with thoughts of how humiliating the experience would be. The following day, I made my way to a PetSmart near her apartment to pick up the dog collar. Laura had also instructed me to wear pink women’s panties all day, promising to check in and wanting proof via pictures throughout the day.
I pulled up to Julie’s apartment in Tempe around 12:45 PM, brushing my teeth in the car to ensure I had the full taste of her sweaty socks in my mouth, not tainted by any food I had eaten. I texted her that I had arrived, and she replied that she would come down to get me. A few moments later, I spotted her emerging from the apartment complex. She looked stunning, clad in a tank top and black yoga pants.
She appeared a little thicker than the last time I had seen her, but it was in a good way, hinting that she had been hiking more and focusing on building her lower body strength. She looked fantastic. Her pretty face was framed by her natural medium brown hair, and her piercing green eyes captivated me. As I walked over to meet her, I asked if there was anything specific she wanted me to clean. “You can start on the floors,” she instructed, “then vacuum my bedroom, and clean out the kitchen and bathroom.”
When we arrived at her apartment, I pulled the dog collar out of the PetSmart bag. “You had to get it in pink?” she chuckled, a playful glint in her eye. I wanted the entire experience to be as humiliating and degrading as possible. She snapped her fingers and pointed to the floor, and I dropped to my knees, she watched me submit, then stepped behind me. I knelt there as she expertly undid the collar, resized it to fit snugly around my neck, and buckled it into place. “There we go,” she said with satisfaction.
As I stood up, she grabbed a dirty gym sock and asked me if I was ready. She raised her hand and stuffed the sock into my mouth. The taste wasn’t as sweaty as I had hoped, but I could tell it wasn’t clean either. The thrill of the moment sent shivers down my spine. She grabbed a piece of duct tape, ripping off about six inches, and pressed it firmly over my lips. A small chuckle escaped her as she made sure it stuck, patting it down to ensure it stayed in place.
Voiceless now, I texted her to ask what I should start with. She instructed me to begin by sweeping the floors, pointing me toward the broom and dustpan. I complied obediently, moving on to use a Swiffer to clean the kitchen and living room floors. As I vacuumed her bedroom, I noticed she had tossed all her dirty laundry behind her TV on the dresser. A little disappointment washed over me; I longed to be forced to suck her dirty post-sex-worn panties like a little cuckold. Still, the humiliation of cleaning the bedroom where she and her boyfriend fucked every night was intoxicating.
Once I finished in the bedroom, I knelt to clean the toilet, sink, and shower in the bathroom. Mid-scrub, she texted me to let me know that one of her friends was coming over. I shot her a quick text asking if she wanted me to keep the collar on and the sweaty sock duct-taped in my mouth. Her swift response was a simple, “Yes, I do.” A wave of arousal surged through me; the thought of being paraded in front of her friend while wearing the dog collar and gagged sent a rush of excitement coursing through my veins.
Her friend arrived about ten minutes later—a slender, attractive Asian girl. My face flushed with embarrassment, but she was kind, not making any mocking remarks, at least not to my face.
After about twenty more minutes, Julie came to inform me that her boyfriend would be home within the hour, signaling that my time was up. I handed over the $500, thanked her, and made my exit, eager to drive back to Sun City as fast as I could to relive the experience in my mind.
On the way home, I texted her, “Damn, I really feel like your little bitch now. That must’ve made you feel like you owned me.” She responded with an emoji of a girl raising her hand, affirming my submission.
Once I got home, I greeted my dad, claiming I was tired and needed a nap. But the truth was, I couldn’t leave my bedroom for a long time. I ended up jacking off to the entire experience five times, consumed by a deep sense of degradation and arousal. It was electrifying.
I recalled fantasizing about the thrill of being dominated by college girls, so I dove into Instagram, seeking out potential new mistresses. I started reaching out with messages like, “Hey, I’m into financial domination. If you’d be interested in having a little bitch who would pay you $100 a week to humiliate them, let me know.” Surprisingly, I received quite a few affirmative responses, but one in particular caught my attention.
Her name was Morgan, a student at one of the Coastal Carolina universities. While she usually kept her mouth closed for photos, whenever she did smile, it was utterly captivating. Morgan had sun-kissed, tan skin and a plethora of alluring bikini shots that highlighted her stunning physique. She was the most fit girl I had encountered in my search, radiating confidence. With large, natural breasts and a height that appeared to be around 5’6”, she exuded a magnetic presence.
Her social media hinted at a lively lifestyle; it was clear she enjoyed partying with her tight-knit group of friends. Morgan seemed like the perfect blend of beauty and dominance, and I was eager to see where this new connection might lead.
I quickly discovered that Morgan enjoyed assigning me humiliating tasks, delighting in the art of degrading me beyond the $100 a week. It was during one of our exchanges that I revealed my interest in cuckolding, suggesting that if she ever wanted to try it, I’d gladly pay an additional $150 for her to make me eat the cum from a used condom after she’d been with another guy. To my excitement, she was fully on board and informed me she had a guy coming over that very night.
A couple of hours later, I received a picture of her entwined with him, her legs wrapped around his waist while she flipped me off with a mischievous grin. Just moments after that, a voice message popped up. My heart raced as I clicked to play it, instantly consumed in a world of desire. The sexy sounds of her genuine moans filled the air—no faking here. I could even hear the unmistakable slap of his balls against her ass as he thrust into her. A rush of embarrassment flooded through me, igniting every nerve in my body. I felt incredibly turned on and humiliated.
Already in bed, I swiftly pulled down my shorts and grabbed my cock, stroking furiously while picturing her with him, and the prospect of her commanding me to eat the cum from the condom. Just as I neared the edge of climax, a ding interrupted me—it was another message from her. “Well, that was fun. He fucked me so good, and I came so hard. I’ll get your latex treat in the mail tomorrow. And remember, I have your dad’s phone number, so you better follow through on eating every last drop of his cum from it, or I’ll show your dad everything.”
In that moment, I exploded. She was a master at this game.
A few days later, a package arrived in the mail, and I snatched it from my dad’s counter, retreating to my bedroom. Inside was a sealed condom, tied at the end, containing a liquid that I assumed to be cum. However, after days in transit, it had become watery. “Maybe this is a bad idea,” I thought, uncertainty creeping in. I contemplated the potential dangers of consuming “spoiled” cum and did a quick search online, but found little information to guide me.
The allure of Morgan's beauty and the thought of her forcing me into this act was intoxicating. The memory of it would undoubtedly be a thrilling fantasy for years to come. “It’s worth the risk,” I finally decided, steeling myself for the degradation that lay ahead.
I clutched the condom in my hand and made my way to the bathroom, determined to avoid any mess in my bedroom from the old jizz. My heart raced as I started recording a video on my phone, intending to send it to Morgan as proof that I was genuinely opening it—no swaps or tricks here.
Finally, I managed to untie the knot, and that's when the smell hit me like a brick wall. It was an unholy combination of rotten fish and algae, the most repugnant odor I had ever encountered. Panic gripped me as I thought, “I can’t do this.” I quickly messaged her, “Hey, this smells really gross. I think it’s spoiled. Not sure if it’s safe to eat this.”
She was online and responded almost right away, "Too bad for you. I don’t care. I went through the trouble of shipping it, and I have your dad’s number. You’ll eat every bit of his cum, or I’ll text your dad everything, bitch."
That was all it took. The way she didn’t care about me, how forceful she was—it turned me on immediately. I messaged her back, “Okay, thanks for making me do it. That’s so hot.”
She replied right away, “Good. Hurry up. I want to see it.”
Feeling a rush of adrenaline, I hit record on the video and looked straight into the camera. “I’m Morgan [last name]’s little bitch, and she’s making me eat the cum out of the condom from another guy who fucked her.” I grabbed the condom and put the open end in my mouth. It didn’t move at first, so I tilted my head back and let the contents pour into my mouth.
The taste and smell hit me hard, and I gagged, swallowing some right away. I glanced at myself on the video looking pathetic, humiliated, but I was also completely turned on. It was a strange, intense thrill that told me just how deep I’d gone down this messed-up path.
I stared into the camera, swallowing another mouthful as more of the warm liquid slid down my throat and settled in my stomach. I figured I’d done enough to satisfy Morgan. My body shook with embarrassment, burning with shame. I opened our Instagram chat, my finger hovering over the “send” button, heart pounding. I paused, wanting to finish myself off, using the shame and humiliation to make the orgasm even more intense before sending the video.
Back in my bedroom, I laid down with the condom resting on my chest, the smell still strong—a gross reminder of what I had just done. As I got close to finishing, I brought the condom back to my mouth, making the moment even hotter. I reopened our chat, uploaded the video, and hit send. The second I sent it, I had an insane orgasm, one of the most intense I’d ever felt. The mix of humiliation and arousal completely took over.
Morgan watched the video right away and messaged back: “You better never forget to send me my $100 every week, or your dad will see all of that.” The thrill of it all hit me again, and I knew I needed to jerk off one more time. Wanting to keep the game going, I asked her if she’d show the video to her hot friends and let me know their reactions for $15 each. She responded quickly, “I’d love to! I already showed the guy, too - he thought it was hilarious.” Morgan knew exactly how to press my buttons, and I was totally hooked.
Meanwhile, all my photography gear had arrived, and I’d launched my wedding photography website. I was getting some inquiries, but I still wasn’t booking any weddings. With my inheritance down to just over $20,000, I decided to take a chance and move to Scottsdale to reconnect with old friends.
A friend of mine, Travis, texted me to say his roommate was moving out and there was a room available in South Scottsdale for just $450 plus utilities. It sounded like a great deal. I told my dad, packed up, and arranged to have a bed delivered to my new place. Being close to the bars and back with friends felt freeing, even though a lot of them had settled down—about half were married and busy with work—but it was still nice to be part of the old scene again.
One good thing about moving to Scottsdale was that Chris lived there too. He was part of 
Zack’s crew back in Phoenix and my favorite person to hang out with. When Chris asked if I wanted to join a fantasy football league he was in, I jumped at the chance. Out of curiosity, I asked who else was in it, and when he mentioned “Nicole P,” my heart skipped a beat. She was insanely attractive—cute face, freckles, bright smile, perfect C-cup breasts, and a slim but toned body. Just thinking about her made me hot.
I signed up for the league right away, excited at the idea of seeing her a few times and maybe impressing her with my fantasy football skills. "Maybe this will turn into something," I thought, though I knew she was probably out of my league.
The draft happened the next week at a friend’s house, and when I got there, everyone was drinking and having a good time. I tried to act confident and make Nicole laugh during the draft, hoping to make an impression. I was feeling good about myself after sticking to my workout routine, thinking maybe I had a chance. The only downside was that she had a long-term boyfriend—though he wasn’t there with her at the time.
After the draft, I enlisted Zack’s help with my team since he was well-versed in fantasy football strategy. I’d drafted poorly, but with his guidance on trades and waiver pickups, we turned my luck around, and by week seven, we found ourselves sitting in second place. I secretly wanted Nicole to know I had a crush on her, curious if she might feel the same. In our league’s WhatsApp group, Zack and I, feeling a bit tipsy, decided to rename our team “Nicole P is hot.” It started as a joke, but within five minutes, I was hitting “save changes,” and the chat erupted.
“Nice new team name, Jake,” Chris chimed in, and soon after, Nicole saw it and replied with a casual “Geeze lol.” Not the response I was hoping for, but a few hours later, I got what I wanted.
Nicole slid into my Whatsapp DMs: “Uh, so do you really think I’m hot?” Keeping it simple and straightforward, I replied, “Yeh, you’re hot 😊.” She responded, “Aww thanks, you’re pretty hot too. If you want to hang out sometime, I’d be down.”
"Yes!" I thought, barely holding back my excitement. I quickly pulled up her Facebook pictures and headed to my bedroom, enthusiastic to check out her bikini shots, photos with her boyfriend, and even those random pics of her feet on the floor. "Wow, I haven’t finished that fast in a while," I thought, feeling a rush. She was gorgeous, and the idea of hanging out with her was thrilling. Even if nothing romantic happened, maybe I could get her to tease me about her boyfriend or mess with me. That would be just as exciting.
She asked if I smoked weed. I wasn’t really into it, but I figured, why not? "Yeah, of course!" I replied, wanting to impress her. "Do you want to come over and smoke?" She responded right away, "Yes! Where do you live?" I gave her my address, and she said she’d be over in about 30 minutes.
My apartment complex was hard to navigate, so I met her at her car. When I saw her, my heart started racing. She looked so hot in her mesh workout shorts and a tight T-shirt, like she had just come from the gym. "Man, I’d suck her toes right now," I thought, trying to stay cool and not seem desperate.
We got inside, and I put on an episode of Game of Thrones. I told her I wasn’t really in the mood to smoke but she could go ahead. I handed her my stash and a frog-shaped pipe. She looked at it, laughing, and said, "What the heck is this?" I grinned and said, "It's my frog pipe." She laughed, "Okay, Jake."
We moved out to the back patio so we wouldn’t stink up the place. She packed a bowl and took a deep hit. “So, what were you up to today?” she asked, and we engaged in small talk about my job. I asked her what she wanted to do that evening, and she replied, “Smoking and watching Game of Thrones sounds good to me. Is there anything you’re hoping for?” “Not really, unless there’s something you want to do,” I said, trying to leave the door open for possibilities. “Jake, I have a boyfriend, so we can’t really do anything, but I want to, for real.”
“Fucking cucked for real,” I thought, feeling a mix of excitement and disappointment. “No problem, we can just watch the show and smoke. Actually, hand me that.” I reached for the pipe from her hands. I put it to my lips, took a hit, and immediately erupted into a coughing fit. She laughed and asked, “Are you alright?” Unable to respond verbally, I nodded instead. “Baby hits, Jake,” she teased. “Dammit, I’m definitely friend zoned,” I thought.
After about two hours of sitting on the couch together, she left a little after 10 PM. I walked her back to her car and gave her a warm hug goodnight. Once inside my apartment, I headed to the back patio for a cigarette, my mind racing from the evening’s events. The horniness from being around Nicole combined with the lingering effects of the weed ignited my desires. I decided to text Laura from Philadelphia, hoping for a little relief. She responded quickly, “Nice timing. I’m with a guy, so you can show my man how pathetic you are too.” That was all it took to push me over the edge; I barely made it through Laura’s hottest Instagram pictures before I exploded.
Exhausted, I cleaned up quickly and planned to head to bed when Nicole texted me. “So, do you still think I’m hot?” I replied enthusiastically, “Fuck yes, Jesus. You’re so damn hot. I’d do anything to you.” She shot back, “So, you’d want to eat me out?” I eagerly responded, “Omg yes.” She replied, “I’m thinking about you eating me out right now and touching myself.” “That’s so hot; I’m stroking myself right now thinking about eating you out too,” I lied. “Let me see,” she challenged. “Fuck,” I thought. How was I going to get hard again so quickly after finishing with Laura?
I pulled up Nicole’s Instagram photos for inspiration. “Maybe this will be easier than I thought,” I realized, quickly getting semi-hard enough to send her a picture. “Nice,” she replied. “Do you want to see me?” “Definitely,” I responded, heart racing. A couple of photos from her stomach down appeared, her hand teasingly nestled inside her panties. “So, what do you want to do to me?” she asked.
Feeling bold, I decided it was time to be honest about my submissive nature, especially since she had used the “I have a boyfriend” excuse a couple of times already. “Honestly, I’d love for you to sit on my face after you’ve been fucked by your boyfriend,” I admitted. “Haha, Jake, we don’t use condoms,” she replied. “Not a problem; I’d still eat you out while you sat on my face after. You’re so hot.” “Omg, that’s dirty, but hot,” she responded, and we continued to sext until she told me she came about ten minutes later.
I pressed for another hangout, hoping that since she now knew about my kink for humiliation, I might be able to convince her to financially dominate me, make me buy her lingerie to tease her boyfriend with, and maybe, if I was lucky, she’d eventually sit on my face after fucking him.
We began chatting throughout the day like friends, planning more nights together. She mentioned that I could come over the next day if I brought her food. I sensed she was starting to test the waters a little. I drove to her place, and she answered the door in sexy pajama pants and a tank top. We decided on sushi, and I placed an order through DoorDash. While we waited, we sat on her couch and played with her dog. “Damn, I’d be your fucking dog,” I joked, and she laughed, “Wow, okay, Jake. Maybe I could arrange that.”
I couldn’t believe I was putting my desires out there, but it felt exhilarating. My heart raced as she moved closer to me on the couch, putting her sexy feet in my hands. “Massage,” she commanded, and I began rubbing her feet. I couldn’t help but fantasize about massaging the feet of a gorgeous girl who might still have cum inside her from earlier that day. I already felt submissive to her, and when the sushi finally arrived, it offered a much-needed escape from the feeling of degradation I had while massaging her feet. She was a little stoned and thoroughly enjoyed the attention, and I devoured my fill of sushi.
Afterward, we hugged, and she said she’d text me, suggesting we hang out again soon. As I left her house and headed back to my apartment, I texted Chris, inviting him to join me at a bar called “The Rack” for some pool. We frequented the place a few times a week, where I could flirt with the attractive servers. My favorite was a stunning 5’7” girl with an athletic build and captivating green eyes. She was in her early twenties and still in shape from playing volleyball, with pale skin and a penchant for cropped tanks that showcased her flat stomach. I had a crush on her and had spent weeks trying to get her number, until one night, she finally caved.
After hanging out at The Rack, April texted me asking if I had any weed. I did, so I invited her over to smoke, and she said she’d be there in 15 minutes. “First Nicole, now April. Maybe my luck is finally turning,” I thought, feeling a thrill at the prospect. She arrived, and my roommate Chris, she, and I settled on the couch with some weed and the TV. I struggled to keep up with them and ended up acting a little foolish, which I sensed might have turned her off a bit.
We continued to text, but instead of trying to hit on her, I shifted gears and started exploring the idea of being her little submissive. She was totally down for it and began teasing me with sultry lingerie pictures and humiliating requests. She was a master at humiliation through text, but the excitement didn’t last long. Shortly after that, she got fired from The Rack. No harm, no foul. I figured it was just the way things went. We exchanged a few more texts afterward, but nothing substantial ever came of it.
As time went on, I found myself down to about $10,000 left from my inheritance. I was paying Morgan $100 a week, Laura $100 a week, and spending money on Nicole in hopes of getting her to dominate me, too. It was clear I needed to let someone go, and Laura was the least fun of the bunch. She seemed to expect the $100 weekly payment with minimal effort on her part, and that wasn’t a sustainable way for me to waste money anymore. So, I texted her, letting her know I wanted out of the arrangement due to her absence.
She immediately protested, “Jake, I have your dad’s phone number, and you made me promise to show him everything if you ever stopped paying. I’m not letting you quit. I’ll request more tasks, but you’re honestly annoying, so don’t expect a lot more.”
Her comment stung a bit, and I shot back, “No, I’m almost out of money, and you only engage when I annoy you, so it’s probably best if we just end things.” After some back-and-forth, she finally said we could wrap it up if I sent her $250, after which I would never hear from her again. Reluctantly, I agreed. That deal was done.
Despite my decision, I was still bleeding money with no new income coming in. After a year of taking time off, I finally realized it was time to find a job, as my photography gig wasn’t bringing in enough cash.
I reached out to my friend Josh, who let me know that the company he worked for was hiring. I applied to Computer Enterprises in Tempe, AZ, and immediately scored an interview. I was offered the job, but it didn’t pay much. It was basically somewhere I could go and not spend money for 8 hours a day. The work environment was vibrant and youthful, filled mostly with newly graduated college kids including a lot of attractive women. A couple of those girls even had a background in porn, and their pasts were the subject of whispers around the office. One of those girls was absolutely smokin’ hot; I honestly couldn’t understand why she hadn’t pursued it further. She would’ve been a star without a doubt.
Meanwhile, I was still working on Nicole. We had enjoyed dinners at upscale steakhouses, and I was always picking up the bar tabs. She still took pleasure in our steamy sexting sessions, which provided me with plenty of material for my own private fantasies. When she asked about my deepest desires, I confided that I fantasized about eating her out after she had sex with her boyfriend. We both got off on that thought, exchanging explicit pictures in the process. However, she made it clear that she couldn’t let me eat her out because of her boyfriend. I seized the opportunity and suggested, “How about I buy some worn after-sex panties from you?”
She raised an eyebrow and asked how much I’d pay. “$100,” I replied. She agreed, and I couldn’t help but think that this would be a sizzling addition to my masturbation sessions. I envisioned myself putting my face inside those panties, my nose right where her boyfriend’s cum would have leaked out.
Curious, I asked if she wanted pictures or videos of how I used them, but she declined, saying, “No, that’s okay.” I sensed that my growing submissiveness might have turned her off a bit, but hey, it was free money for her. We agreed to meet at the gym a couple of days later to make the exchange.
When I met up with her, she looked absolutely stunning in her workout attire. The knowledge that there was a pair of creampie-filled panties in her car while we worked out together only heightened my arousal. As we left, I followed her to her car, handing over the $100. She handed me a brown paper bag, and I could feel the panties sliding around in the bottom.
She hugged me tightly, kissing me on the neck, and said, “You’re so hot.” I turned my head to hers and replied, “No. You’re so hot. Thank you.”
After that, we hopped into our cars and drove back to our respective places. The moment I returned home, I felt a rush of excitement at the thought of using the freshly creampie-filled panties. I didn’t want to suck on them yet because I wanted to preserve the intoxicating scent that emanated from the dried white spots which was a thrilling blend of her juices and his cum.
I slipped the panties over my head, positioning the part that had touched her pussy right against my nose, forcing me to inhale deeply. The aroma was seared into my memory, and in that moment, I exploded in a degrading, euphoric orgasm.
I texted her afterward, curious if she enjoyed humiliating me. Her response was playful: “A little. Hehe.” I let her know that if she ever wanted me to come over and kneel before her, hand-washing her dirty creampie panties in front of her, I’d be more than willing. She replied that it sounded like a plan, but reminded me to be cautious since she had a boyfriend and was worried about others finding out about us.
Soon enough, she came over to watch TV shows and get high again. Dressed in cozy sweatpants and a tank top, with her sandals showcasing her sexy little feet, she settled in beside me on the couch. A little high, she cuddled up against me, and I instinctively wrapped my arm around her.
After some time, I decided to make my move. I leaned in for a kiss, but she turned her head away, evading me. Undeterred, I slid my right hand inside the front waistband of her sweatpants, and to my delight, she shifted positions, giving me easier access to slip my fingers into her panties. She was completely shaven.
With my arm around her, I had to reach down further to find her pussy, and once I did, I couldn’t believe how perfect it felt. I slipped a finger inside her, and she tightened around my index finger, leaving me in awe of her incredible tightness. I couldn’t help but fantasize about how good my dick would feel being squeezed by her, so I inserted a second finger. She relaxed more, sighed, and began to grind against my fingers, clearly enjoying the sensation.
As I kissed her, I pondered my next move, craving to taste her so badly. I sank to the floor, gently pulling down her sweatpants and panties. She arched her back to assist me, and as I drew closer to her pussy, I caught a whiff of her intoxicating aroma. She had clearly been fucked and filled by her boyfriend before coming over.
“Just what you’ve been asking for,” she giggled, grabbing the back of my head and pushing it into her wetness. I extended my tongue, immediately tasting the thrilling combination of her juices and his cum. The heat of the moment overwhelmed me, and I asked if she would sit on my face while I ate her out for as long as she wanted. “Okay,” she replied with a sultry smile.
We shifted positions, with me lying back as she straddled my face, her dirty cum-filled pussy hovering tantalizingly above me. “I bet you feel like my little bitch now,” she teased. I gripped her hips and pulled her into my face, eagerly diving my tongue deep into her as I cleaned her out.
For about 15 minutes, I worshipped her, and she climaxed, leaving her intoxicating scent smeared all over my face. She whispered that since she had a boyfriend, she didn’t mind me eating her out, but she couldn’t reciprocate. “That’s fine,” I replied, sensing that she relished the power she held over me.
