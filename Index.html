Preface
I wrote this with the hope that individuals experiencing Schizophrenic episodes, as well as their family members and friends, can recognize how these episodes can develop and make themselves apparent. Through my analysis, I’ve learned that many Schizophrenic episodes follow similar patterns, often triggered by excessive stress on the brain. Based on my own experience and understanding, it feels as though the brain fractures into two different parts, one conscious and one subconscious. The new subconscious part creates a complex puzzle through associations you make with auditory and visual cues that draw you in, compelling you to uncover more of the puzzle each day. The suspected causes and reasoning behind why my brain fracture occurred and how it revealed itself is drawn out inside the covers of this book. I’ve also written in detail about the way I uncovered the clues to the puzzles and the shocking beliefs that I had during this episode.  
The arrival of the “voices” in my head right at the time where my stress had reached its peak was uncanny and too coincidental to ignore. I refer to them as "voices" but, for me, they weren’t audible in the traditional sense. Instead, it felt more like an upload of information, teleported into my brain my telekinesis by an entity able to communicate directly within my brain. While these entities seemed to have accents and distinct ways of speaking, I think that they built those associations with people I knew from my life typically friends, enemies, even celebrities. This gave the voices camouflage, allowing them to blend in and exert even more influence over my thoughts.
They were extremely convincing continually stating that my survival and the survival of humanity was at state. This left me no choice but to believe them and damn were they convincing. It felt as though they were sent by an external force to help me solve the mysteries of the world.
In researching Schizophrenia further, I discovered that many others have reported similar experiences with voices starting to appear inside their head when they were stressed to their capacity. This has led many, including myself, to wonder whether these voices serve as some sort of intervention to stress, corrupting that section of the brain and breaking it off into a new entity. The consistency of these experiences among people with Schizophrenia seems too uniform to be purely coincidental. It seems highly unlikely to me that a break in the brain due to stress overload would produce such a similar pattern of delusional beliefs in so many isolated examples. Are we so much like computers that there can be corruption that creates the same patterns of belief so closely in so many different isolated examples? If so, that potentially opens a whole new world of possibilities in my opinion. 
The "voices" effectively created a new world for me full of new puzzles that I needed to keep waking up each day to solve to continue my pursuit of the conclusion of their guidance. The voices cautioned me not to reveal their messages or share anything about our "mission," threatening that I wouldn’t like the consequences if I did. Although they initially prevented me from succumbing to the relentless amount of stress I had, the pursuit of the puzzle they created for me cost me much more in the long run. 
The voices have relayed an interest in helping others with the disease to avoid the same pitfalls of delusion that I willingly stepped right into. I think that’s all we have to hold onto now. Perhaps they believed the delusions as much as I did, and we idiotically perpetuated each of our delusions back and forth (they’re saying that we did, but I don’t fucking believe them right now), deepening the entanglement. 
Here I sit with the assistance of their guidance recollecting the stories the best we can. I’m aware that most of my thoughts were simply delusions created by listening to the “voices,” but it seems there was something larger than just my brain at play. I’m compelled to believe that based on the similarities of patterns and similarities of themes between myself and others with the disease. Also, my creativity was never one of my strongest suits and the incredible journey that they took me on was unlike anything I could’ve come up with on my own. Frequently I presumed that I was a part of a Black Mirror episode because the themes were so intricate and borderline science fiction. 
It was as though my brain had been hijacked, and I became a passenger in my own life for several months. To be honest, that’s still how it feels to me, and perhaps it always will. There are some things that I did that I could never have imagined doing before they arrived. They frequently pushed me to the brink of doing extremely dangerous and potentially deadly things and then they would pull me back at the last second. Sometimes they were too late. Did I create that pattern of structure which they mimicked their behavior after through my own actions and the previous events of my life? 
In the end the way the voices structured their communication and puzzles in a way that led to a coherent conclusion to the puzzle. This also strikes me as strange because the individual stories and events could seem so disjointed at times that it was hard for me to believe they could come to such a concise conclusion. 
It continues to fascinate me how real and influential these voices were to me. When I first encountered them, they felt supernatural, as though they held an authority you cannot ignore. Let’s face it, when you’re overwhelmed by your current situation you want to believe something greater is real. They took the heed as that “something greater,” that kept me wanting to experience another day, one day at a time. But how would they know that’s what I needed? How could they have known when they needed to show up? How are they programmed to affect the same lost souls in the same type of search for greater meaning? 
The book is divided into two parts. Chapters One through Six cover the background and events leading up to my first Schizophrenic episode. The remaining chapters recount the actual stories, events, and experiences I lived through described as accurately as I can remember. In the beginning chapters there are anecdotes and themes of sexual deviancy which I believe contributed to my eventual breakdown. I apologize if any of these details are unsettling, but I felt it was important to provide the full context of everything I think contributed to my breakdown without shying away from details that embarrass me. I think this is important to the integrity of the story. 
It’s incredible how my brain operated under Schizophrenia. It created a web of associations, connecting songs, TV shows, movies, and even simple noises or notifications from my phone to form a pattern of beliefs. These associations were relayed to me by what I recognized as separate entities inside my mind. I genuinely believed these entities were external voices speaking to me from another dimension or realm. It felt as though they had logged into my brain or hacked my consciousness. They would ask me questions, give me directions, and set tasks that I could never have conceived of on my own, leading me to believe these thoughts weren’t originating from my own mind. At that time the only plausible explanation for me was that they were external.
I hope you find something valuable in this book, whatever your reason for reading it. I think it is an interesting and valuable story for everyone to delve further into the innerworkings of the mind, to fully embrace how dark and powerful the mind can be. I’m hoping that it might save your life or someone else’s life if you come across someone experiencing these types of delusions in the future.  
I felt compelled to share this story, believing it could be helpful for anyone affected by Schizophrenia. In my mind, if it helps even one person then it was all worth it. I might be lost to the cause, but I truly hope this changes someone’s life for the better or else I wouldn’t have spent all the time it took to write it. It’s been quite the journey. I’m still alive, and the voices are still with me most of the time.
This is my story…


“Jake this is going to blow up in your face in the worst way.  If I were you, I would dread every single phone call, every single email, every single weird look anyone shoots you.  If you want to play games with me, I’ll play games with you.  I love playing games, but only the ones I win of course.
I know your dad has a pretty high tolerance for you even though you’re an idiot, but he’s about to lose that last, hopeful little shred of respect he is clinging to.
What a shame.
Goddess Jessica”










Chapter 1 – Sexual Classical Conditioning
I’ve always had a sense that I was meant for something greater, even though I haven’t quite figured out what that was yet. I had always been a kind person ready to lend a hand to anyone, even strangers. I sometimes wondered if people had taken advantage of my generosity over the years, but when it was an attractive woman, I didn’t mind at all. I wasn’t cynical enough yet to build walls or guard my heart yet.
I stood 5’10” tall with deep brown eyes that drew people in, while my dark brown hair, usually styled into a purposefully messy, spiked look, gave off a carefree vibe. I went to the gym every day, maintaining a lean, ripped physique at 170 pounds, complete with defined abs and pecs. I didn’t focus much on leg day, but my frame was slender enough that not many noticed.
My personality was laid-back, with a sharp sense of humor. I never took life too seriously and was always ready with a joke or a smile. That was me—a mix of contradictions, charm, and unspoken desires, still searching for that elusive "something more.”
In high school, I was a bit awkward, so when it was time to start fresh after graduation, I headed to Arizona State University, eager to leave my past behind. I joined a fraternity at ASU, which introduced me to a tight-knit group of guys who became some of my closest friends. 
The campus was incredible, stretching about 1 mile by 1 mile in the middle of Tempe, Arizona. Mill Avenue extended directly off the campus and was about a ¾ mile strip of bars leading up to a mountain known as “A-Mountain,” because they put a giant golden “A” on it. My freshman year, before I even joined my fraternity, I was at a pre-rush party with some alumni from the frat I eventually pledged to. I got excessively drunk and told them I would paint the letter "A" red and black to match our fraternity colors to get into the frat. I barely remembered the conversation, but thankfully, they never made me follow through with it.
Fast forward to post-rush initiation, where we went room to room, taking shots with all of the active members of the fraternity. I ended up taking around seven shots in about an hour and was completely obliterated. I was slurring my words and stumbling, but they hoped I’d sober up on the way to the bar they had rented out, so they loaded me onto the bus anyway. I don't remember much, but apparently, I rested my head on the seat in front of me and vomited all over the floor of the bus. The guys quickly dragged me off the bus and hid me in a pitch-black party room, which had a stripper pole and a couch. I vaguely recall waking up disoriented in the darkness, struggling for about 20 minutes to find the door. When I finally got out, a couple of guys who stayed behind were hanging out in the house. Instead of heading to the bar with the others, I was content just drinking and smoking cigarettes with them on the frat house balcony.
I had this faint memory of falling down a flight of cement stairs later in the night, but I woke up fine besides a massive headache and a looming feeling of dread, lying in my own vomit on the floor of the balcony. I managed to trek back to my dorm, which was a five-minute walk to Palo Verde Main from the old frat row by the rail road tracks near Sun Devil Stadium.
Despite my drunken antics on our bid night, the fraternity still allowed me to pledge the fraternity – maybe they felt guilty that I had almost died. I was getting a weekly allowance of $120 from my loans, which my dad deposited into my checking account on Mondays. It was meant to last the week, but typically by Thursday, I’d be running low from spending most of it on beer and food. My grades were solid—three A’s and a B—so I figured I was doing fine just maybe partying a little too much. But in reality, I was a mess, getting way too drunk way too often. It wasn’t just about grades as most of my classes didn’t require attendance, so I’d just study a few hours before exams and still ace them. Brief Calculus was the only class I couldn’t pull that trick with, so I ended up dropping it when my last-minute study approach failed. I was just having too much “fun.”
During this early time at college, I met a girl named Cecily in my dorm. She was a gorgeous brunette with an olive complexion and dark brown eyes—a total sweetheart. She was high school friends with one of the guys pledging my fraternity, Josh, so we instantly had things to talk about. She also loved Dave Matthews Band, which is how we met. She was playing his music on her CD player, and I popped my head in to her dorm room and said, “Dave?” From there, we struck up a conversation. We began hanging out a lot, even kissed a few times, but I wasn’t sure if those kisses meant anything more.
One Saturday night, my fraternity threw a party at the frat house, and Cecily came with some of her sorority sisters. I was sitting with Cecily and another one of the girls from her sorority named Hanna, with my arms around both of them on either side of me. Hanna turned to me and said, “Well, you must feel like a pimp right now.” That was all the signal I needed. I leaned in and started making out with her. Cecily, understandably hurt, immediately left the party. I stayed behind with the other girl, Hanna.
Hanna was a stunning Asian girl from Oklahoma, with dark brown hair and eyes. She was built athletically, around 5’5” and 120 pounds, with a toned body from running cross country through high school. Things heated up quickly after Cecily left, and Hanna and I ended up lying down on the futon. I started fingering her and tried to take things further by removing her pants. I was ready to go all the way, but she whispered, “No sex.” I respected her boundary and instead kissed her again before going down on her. It was the furthest I’d ever been with a girl as hot as her, and I was completely lost in the moment.
Someone accidentally walked in on us and abruptly shut the door leaving us alone again, which startled Hanna, but instead of stopping, she leaned back in, even more determined. She straddled my face naked, pressing her pussy against my lips, and I eagerly continued, completely lost in the sensation. After about 15 minutes, I was drenched in her juices, and she climaxed. She gave me a quick blowjob and I was so turned on from going down on her that it didn’t take long for me to orgasm. 
The next day, I had to face Cecily. I played it off like I didn’t know what we were, which is why I went for Hanna and she gave me a second chance. She made it clear we were exclusive now, and I agreed. But less than a week later, I messed it up. I was drunk and horny and texted Hanna, asking if she wanted to come over. I guess I was selfish and looking for more action than Cecily was giving me. Hanna came over to my dorm, and just like before, she straddled my face and let me quench my submissive desire to bury my tongue in her pussy. We both ended up passing out in my bet but I couldn’t remember much other than her sitting on my face. When I awoke she was gone and my roommate gave me the glum news that Cecily already knew everything. That was the end of us.
Hanna and I hooked up a few more times after that. The last time, she told me she didn’t want to do anything to me but said I could go down on her if I wanted. I eagerly agreed. I quickly pulled her pants off and pulled her on top of me. She straddled my face, and I went to work for nearly 45 minutes until she climaxed, giving me nothing in return. She left after that, and while I would’ve gladly done it for the rest of my life, that was pretty much the end of our hookups. I still saw her around campus, and sometimes she'd study with a few guys in my fraternity, but that was the extent of us hanging out after her using my face as a dildo a few times early on in our freshman year. 
After an eight-week pledge program, I was initiated as an active brother. Our pledge class was huge—45 guys, larger than the entire active fraternity at the time. It was a great group, and there was always something going on. We’d hang out at the house every night we weren’t heading out to support our fraternity sports teams or participating in date parties, socials, or participating in philanthropies. At the house we found plenty of things to do and it was like a party existed every night there. The big parties we put on there were legendary. We had the biggest Christmas party on campus, and one of the brothers built a 14-foot reindeer covered in Christmas lights that you could see all the way from my dorm. The night of the Christmas party there must’ve been 500 people there. The halls were packed shoulder to shoulder with brothers in the fraternity, a few select guests, and an insane amount of girls. 
Around the time of the Christmas party we had started hanging out a lot with another sorority often. They had assigned girls to our fraternity to coach us for their philanthropy. Philanthropies were events put on by the sororities that multiple fraternities participated in to try to win a trophy declaring them as the winners. There were often a few large events like football, tug of war, or other athletic events. They always threw in a couple additional less objective events so they could manipulate the standings a bit at the end of they needed to. They typically had one or two fraternities in their philanthropies that they had great relations with and wanted to have them place in the top three.  These more objective events usually consisted of things like lip syncing or a performance of some kind. Two of the girls that I met from the sorority became a couple of my good friends for the rest of college. Their names were Stephanie and Laura. They were best friends, and Stephanie was a gorgeous 5’3” Asian with a great body, tan skin, a confident, sexy voice, beautiful dimples and the cutest smile. Laura was pretty as well, but not as stunning as Stephanie. She was about the same height with brown hair and eyes, with pale skin, and a very slender build.
I had a crush on Stephanie, but she was pursued by most everyone in our fraternity as well as other guys throughout the campus. She was one of the hottest girls in her sorority and at ASU for sure. I was friend zoned from the beginning, but at the time, I was too inexperienced to recognize it. That didn't stop me from pursuing her like a devoted puppy for four years.
It was as if there existed an unspoken rule in her relationships: any guy she dated had to accept our friendship. I had even made a few attempts to persuade her to explore a more dominant dynamic between us but she declined my attempts to convince her to use me. I always found myself at her beck and call anyways. Particularly on those bleary Tuesday and Friday mornings our Junior year at 8:15 AM, when she’d swing by my apartment, park her car, and awaken me from my sleep to drive her to her early class. She didn’t seem to have an issue taking advantage of my crush on her when it suited her well. On especially stormy days, I’d even brave the elements to pick her up afterward if I happened to be awake.
One rainy day stands out in vivid detail: she called me, drenched and asking for a ride back to her car. When I arrived, I couldn’t pull all the way up because there was a gate blocking the road. In just the 25 yards she needed to walk to my car she was soaked to the bone, her hair clinging to her delicate features. Instinctively, I draped my jacket over her sexy tanned legs, feeling a longing swirl within me.
Another morning, after a night spent with a guy, she called me for a ride home. I was hungover myself and let her know I wasn’t really up to it, somewhat fearing that was a slippery slope of allowing her to continually take advantage of me but only on her terms. She must’ve gotten the feeling that maybe the request was too manipulative because she ultimately found another way. I was always willing to do anything for her, willing to drop everything at a moment’s notice.
There was also a day our junior year when I was still crushing on her when she was dating a guy from another fraternity, and she was going on vacation with him. She invited me over to her condo while she packed, and then had me help her pick out lingerie for her to wear with him on vacation. In that moment, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was subtly trying to dominate me, enjoying her power while leaving me weaker and more vulnerable to her intoxicating charms.
Finally, one night, emboldened by a few too many drinks, I mustered the courage to ask if I could pay her to financially dominate me. She quickly shot me down, saying she wasn't comfortable with it. I suspected she preferred to be the one composing the power dynamic. Not wanting to ruin our friendship, I steered away from asking her about it again, and we remained friends. 
After my freshman year we lost our Fraternity house. Michael Crow, the President at ASU, had an agenda of claiming imminent domain on the frat houses near the football stadium and we were the first house crossed off his list. College was still fun after that and the fraternity survived without moving into the ASU Fraternity housing offered, which was just like another dorm. We all moved into different apartments throughout the area and would alternate locations for smaller parties. By this time, I had made my closest friends in the fraternity, and we separated into a niche group who would hang out the most often. We would still frequently get together for our sporting events, and other social events, so it wasn’t like losing the house destroyed all the relationships, but it did make it a little more difficult for everyone to get together as much. 
In 2007, I had a fling with a girl named Laura from Stephanie’s sorority who was dating a guy from a rival fraternity. She had a cute charm that caught my attention over time. We’d been flirting for a while, frequently sexting about all kinds of dirty things—she had a crush on me, and I wasn’t about to turn down the opportunity to hook up with her. One rainy day, she asked if I wanted to watch some movies at my apartment. We had hung out a lot in groups before, but never on a one on one basis, so I figured she wanted to more than just watch movies. She came over to my apartment and we walked up the road to blockbuster.  
My heart raced as we wandered the aisles of the video rental store. I couldn’t stop thinking about massaging her sexy feet and feeling submissive to her. After some consideration, she picked out Cruel Intentions and The Island, and we headed back to my apartment. It was perfect—my roommate wasn’t home, so we had the place to ourselves. She stretched out on the couch, casually resting her feet in my lap with her sexy feet right in front of my face. I couldn’t help but admire how beautiful they were.
After what felt like an eternity, I finally worked up the courage to ask if she wanted a foot massage. She grinned and said, “sure if you want to give me one,” and I start massaging them. My mind raced with forbidden thoughts—I wanted to suck on her toes, to feel like her little foot slave. As we sat there, I slowly leaned forward, laying down with her feet resting on my chest, and as I massaged them, I kissed her toes. They were sweaty, but I didn’t care—I was in Heaven.
With a surge of adrenaline, I closed my eyes and started sucking on her toes, my heart pounding in my chest. As I massaged and sucked on one foot, I began fingering her through the pajama pants she’d worn, and she responded by pressing her other foot into my face. The sensation overwhelmed me. We eventually switched feet, and I continued, feeling utterly humiliated yet wildly turned on by the fact that I was worshipping this girl’s sweaty, dirty feet. It was intoxicating.
At some point, she asked if I wanted to take things to the bedroom. She made it clear that she wanted me to go down on her but didn’t want to do anything to me because she had a boyfriend. I guess that felt less like cheating in her mind. Without hesitation, I led her to my room, where she laid back on the bed, and I lowered my face to her pussy. The thought of her potentially fucking her boyfriend recently consumed me, turning me on even more. The idea that I was eating her out after she’d probably just fucked him felt like the ultimate act of submission. She grabbed my head and pushed my face deeper into her until she finally came.
Afterward, we went back to the couch and about five minutes later, the front door swung open, and her boyfriend walked in. I guess we should’ve remembered to lock the door, although maybe that would’ve been suspicious too. My heart nearly stopped, but we weren’t fooling around anymore at that point, so he didn’t catch us. They left together shortly after, and even though I hadn’t gotten any physical satisfaction from the encounter, the memory of being treated like her submissive was more than enough to get me off later.
Shortly after that she and her boyfriend broke up because he found out she cheated on him with me. I’m sure she spun the story, probably told him that she didn’t do anything, that I did it all to her. And to be honest, that was mostly true. But she loved every second of it, just as much as I did. The rest of college was a blur of parties and random hookups. 
Another girlfriend I briefly dated in college was named Briana. She was a fiery 5'4" beauty, with striking brown hair and captivating brown eyes. Her flawless tan skin complemented her incredible figure, and she possessed large, perfectly shaped breasts that added to her draw. Briana had a presence that was hard to ignore, exuding both confidence and charm, making her someone who effortlessly turned heads wherever she went. I had a crush on her long before she even knew I existed. We shared a Calculus class my freshman year, and I always thought she was the hottest girl in the room. She was from Jersey so she had one of those nails on chalkboard accents, but for some reason I found it hot on her. She was direct and almost demanding which I found sexy. 
It wasn’t until we were introduced by a mutual friend, Dave, one of my fraternity brothers, that I finally got a chance to talk to her. We started hanging out at parties, and eventually, at the beginning of 2008, we kissed for the first time at my apartment.
A couple of weeks into dating, we had fooled around but hadn’t had sex yet when Briana went on a previously scheduled trip to Rocky Pointe, Mexico, without me. When she and my friends returned they let me know she had cheated on me while I was there. Oddly enough, I wasn’t too heartbroken, but she started questioning if we should break up. I didn’t want to look like a fool for wanting to continue dating her after her cheating on me and not knowing if she wanted to, so I told her if she had any doubts, we should just end things. We decided to stay friends, but things got messy from there.
One night, we were hanging out with one of her guy friends, watching a movie in her living room. I was supposed to take her to a concert in Tucson the next day, but that night, after I pretended to fall asleep on the couch, she took her friend to her bedroom. I stayed awake, listening to them have sex just 10 feet away, and I walked out of the apartment and slammed the door hurt that she didn’t respect me enough to wait until I wasn’t around to hook up with a guy when she knew I still liked her. 
The next day, I confronted her about it, but she denied everything. We still went to the Taking Back Sunday concert in Tucson, and even after all that, I couldn’t shake my feelings for her. I kept trying to pursue her, despite her cheating on me.
After classes a few days later, I went over to her place to hang out and watch tv. We were sitting on the couch, and I couldn’t stop staring at her feet—her tan feet with French-tipped toes looked so sexy. I offered her a foot massage, and she stretched out her legs, wearing tiny mesh shorts and a t-shirt. I started massaging her feet, hoping it would lead to something more. As I moved my hands slowly up her legs, trying to get closer to her pussy, she stopped me, saying it was just a massage. I awkwardly went back to rubbing her feet. Then, we heard the door slam in the kitchen. One of her roommates had come home. I wasn’t sure whether I should stop massaging her feet out of embarrassment or keep going like nothing was out of the ordinary. I decided to just keep going, though I probably looked like a whipped puppy.
I was still trying everything I could to win her back, paying for dinners, taking her out, anything. One hot summer day, we worked at her cousin’s wedding—her cousin was a florist, and we were helping to set things up. Briana, always playful, sat on top of a cart while I pushed her around, taking her wherever she wanted to go. We passed an older man who was setting up at the wedding, and she turned to me, laughing, “He probably thinks you’re my little bitch, pushing me around.” Despite the sting of her words, I continued hanging out with her, still hoping I could somehow win her over again.
After a few months of following Briana around like a devoted servant my luck finally began to turn one night when I was out at the bars on Mill Avenue. I ran into Lauren, a girl I had seen around the fraternity a few times. She had a twin sister named Andrea, and both of them were stunning—about 5’7” with brown hair, with great bodies, beautiful brown eyes, and big, bright smiles. Lauren had a slight lazy eye, but to me, she was the more classically beautiful of the two.
That night, Lauren had just turned 21, and we immediately hit it off. I turned on the charm, making her and her friends laugh all night long. By the end of the night, we exchanged numbers, and soon enough, we were hanging out regularly. Within a few weeks, we were officially dating, and I genuinely thought I had met the girl I was going to marry.
Through Lauren, I met a whole new circle of friends that she had known from high school—people like Tim, Dan, Brad, Chris, Mike (two of them, actually), Patrick, Travis, and their girlfriends. We spent most weekends drinking at house parties or heading out to the bars on Mill Avenue. Typically, when heading out to the bars we’d go to our favorite spot, Cue Club.
Everything with Lauren started off so well it felt almost like a dream. Within the first year, we were already imagining our future together and discussing potential names for our kids. However, we did come from very different backgrounds. My family had always been relatively stable, with my parents having enough money to provide for everything we needed and not getting into fights very often. Lauren's family, on the other hand, struggled. Her mother had a gambling addiction, which made things even harder for them and her parents fought all the time always seemingly on the edge of a divorce.
It felt like I was able to bring some much-needed stability into Lauren's life, especially during that period when she seemed to need it most. Our time together was filled a lot of fun, laughter, and adventure. Dating during my senior year was a blast, and even after I graduated in 2009, we continued to have so much fun together. The connection we shared felt deep and full of promise.
Cue Club was legendary, not just for the drinks, but for the crowd it drew. It was a pool hall located right in the middle of Mill Avenue, which was the main bar street at ASU.  The hottest girls from ASU either worked there or regularly drank there. Usually, all three of our favorite bartenders would be working too. Lindsey, the tall, slender blonde, always kept things fun and had a witty sense of humor and coy smile. Then there was Amelie, standing at 5’5”, with a striking figure and a face so stunning she could’ve passed for a famous porn star. And finally, there was Sam who was the queen of the place. At 5’2”, she was tiny but confident, she had this killer smile that lit up the whole bar. She knew how gorgeous she was, and I could only imagine how often she got hit on every weekend. I always thought she was incredibly hot, but she was way out of my league, and besides, I was dating Lauren.
Those weekends at Cue Club were some of the best times of my life—wild nights, unforgettable friendships, and the excitement at being surrounded by the hottest girls from ASU.
I usually blended in well in most environments, but whenever I drank too much, my inhibitions crumbled, and my sexual urges surged. I vividly remember multiple occasions even after starting to date Lauren where I would spot an attractive girl at the bar, feeling overwhelmed with lust, and rushing to hail a cab just to race home and indulge in deviant porn. My obsession with female domination had been with me for as long as I could remember.  
After a night of drinking my senior year of college, my roommate Josh came back from the bars to find me passed out with my hand down my pants and my laptop still open. I’d been trying to get off to some hardcore femdom porn, and there it was, displayed for him to see. He was cool about it and didn’t judge me but there was some teasing me about being into weird shit like that. 
My tastes were wide-ranging and intense. I was into everything: face-sitting, pegging, enforced chastity, toe-sucking, foot worship, humiliation, cuckolding, and even financial domination. These fantasies would spill over into my real life. I’d imagine the hot girls I knew or the ones I saw at bars doing these things to me. The idea of being controlled, used, and humiliated by beautiful women had a hold on me. 
Chapter 2 – “Professional” “Life”
In 2009, I graduated right into the middle of one of the worst recessions the United States had seen since the early '80s, armed with a degree in Business Marketing that suddenly felt useless. The job market was horrible, especially for someone looking for marketing positions—no one was hiring. It was brutal.
With few options, I ended up taking my first job as a recruiter for a staffing company, pulling in a meager $32,000 a year. It was a far cry from the career I had imagined after four years of college at Arizona State University, earning a business degree. It felt like life had dealt me a shitty financial hand, and felt the returning feeling of impending doom. “Is this what the rest of my life will be like?” Nope, it got worse. 
My boss in my first job out of college was an absolute dictator. It was a staffing company and our office was 1,000 miles away from the next closest branch, which gave him the autonomy he wanted to manage with as much pressure as he felt like. It was suffocating, the hours were brutal, and the positions we were trying to fill were so specialized that finding qualified candidates was like searching for a needle in a haystack. One day, after over a year of working there and always grading towards the middle to top quarter of recruiters in the company, I came into the office and he told me to take the day off to "think about how I could improve." No warning, no conversation—just a day off without pay. It was insane behavior, and I couldn’t believe he was getting away with it.
Financially, I was barely scraping by. My salary and commissions were just enough to keep me afloat, but not enough to enjoy life the way I had hoped after graduation. It was frustrating—living paycheck to paycheck, trying to support both myself and Lauren, all while feeling like my potential was being wasted.
I managed to stick it out with the staffing company until 2011, but I felt like I needed a change. One day, Lauren and I met up with our friend Mike J who I had met through her.  He and some other friends were eating at a restaurant in Tempe for dinner and to have a couple of drinks.  He was speaking about interviewing with a large global logistics company for an inside sales position. The idea intrigued me. It sounded like a much better career path than the dead-end job I was stuck in at the time. The role was part of an accelerated inside sales program that was designed to promote employees into field roles within two years or less. The thought of fast-tracking to an outside sales position, where I’d get a higher base salary and a shot at serious commission, was too tempting to pass up. I applied, was scheduled for an interview, and had the job within a week. My luck seemed to be turning.
The new company was a welcome change from the three-man office I was in at the staffing company. It was a inside sales force about 60 people strong, and we also housed a lot of the national operational teams and our leads department. Most of the employees were younger fresh out of college, so we’d all frequently meet up for happy hours and go out with each other on the weekends. It was a lot of fun, but the salary and commission of the inside sales role were wearing on me and wearing on my and my relationship with Lauren. I just wasn’t making enough money still to support both of our nights out all of the time in addition to all of our other expenses. I was always just barely scraping by. 
By the end of 2012, I got the news I had been waiting for: I was being considered for a promotion to a field sales role, with the options being either Houston or Philadelphia. My first stop was Houston, but I wasn’t exactly impressed. The parts of the city I saw were rough, and to top it off, the hotel I stayed in had had a murder there just the week before. The one bright spot of the trip was catching up with Laura from ASU. She had moved out there to study for her Masters in Psychology.
Things between Lauren and I had become a bit shaky. After years of her schooling and the distance it created, we weren’t even officially dating anymore. To me it kind of felt like she just used me as a financial crutch for awhile while she finished her nursing school. I texted Laura and asked if she wanted to meet me at the hotel or head out to a bar. Her apartment was nearby so she said she wanted to and agreed to swing by the hotel first. By the time she arrived at around 8:00 p.m., I was already six Blue Moons deep—drinks courtesy of the company. They had told me to have a good time, and I took full advantage of it.
We didn’t have much time to stay out, so after a quick beer at the hotel, we hit the town, ending up at a cowboy bar complete with punch machines, pool tables, and flirty servers. As the night went on, I decided to bring up something I had mentioned to Laura in passing before—that I had a thing for financial domination. She was studying to become a Doctor of Psychology after ASU in Houston, aiming to be a therapist, and I think she found my kink… intriguing.
Financial domination was a newer fetish at the time which consisted of a submissive man giving a woman money as a power exchange. Usually he would give her money to humiliate him or tease him about her superiority and dominance over him. It gave me a stir of humiliation to be used in that way, and to submit to gorgeous women in that fashion. 
I decided to take a chance and bent down to slip a twenty-dollar bill into her cowboy boot. She looked at me with a curious smile. “Oh, so you really do like this, huh?” she teased, referring to the financial domination I had mentioned.
“Yeah, I do,” I admitted with a grin. She smiled back, clearly enjoying the exchange of power. There was something sexy about it—the way she held that control, even in something as small as a twenty slipped into her boot. It was a brief moment, but it stayed with me, that quiet understanding between us.
We ended up staying out far too late, caught up in the fun of the night. Laura had met some guy she seemed into, but around midnight, I knew I had early interviews looming the next morning. We headed back to the hotel, and I asked if she wanted to stay over with me. She agreed but quickly added, “I can’t have sex or anything—I’m on my period.” I wasn’t too fazed by that and figured maybe I could still get something out of the situation, so I told her it was fine, and we stumbled back into my hotel room.
As soon as she kicked off her cowboy boots, my eyes were drawn to her feet. I casually asked if she wanted me to massage them, and she shrugged, saying, “Sure.” She was still wearing her socks, damp from sweating in the boots and the extra humidity from the rain that night. As I rubbed her feet, I started moving them closer to my face. She was just relaxing, completely oblivious to how turned on I was.
I shifted my position, lying on my back so that her feet rested on my chest, just inches from my face. Slowly, I began sliding her socks off, and she flexed her legs slightly, helping them slip free. Now her sweaty, bare feet were right in front of me. The scent of them—musky and warm—filled the air. I grabbed her left foot, continuing to massage it, then slipped her toes into my mouth. I started sucking, running my tongue along each toe. She didn’t pull away—in fact, she pushed her toes deeper into my mouth, like she was making me suck them now.
She chuckled, making some teasing remark about how much I enjoyed her feet, but I was too lost in the moment to care. I kept going, moving from her toes to the balls of her feet, licking up and down the soles, cleaning them with my tongue like her little toy. The salty taste mixed with the soft humiliation of the whole situation—it drove me wild. The fact that I had paid her $20 earlier and was now worshipping her feet while she barely paid me any attention made me hornier than ever.
Desperate for more, I pleaded with her to let me eat her pussy. She reminded me, almost dismissively, that she was on her period, but I didn’t care—I was too deep in my submissive haze to think rationally. Despite my begging, she refused, uninterested in taking things any further. She was relishing the control, savoring how I was completely at her mercy without expecting anything in return. And honestly, I was too caught up in it to stop.
I continued sucking on her toes, each one slick with my saliva as I worshipped her feet like a man possessed. The mixture of her indifference and the sheer eroticism of the situation had me hooked. Eventually, exhaustion overtook me, and I passed out, her feet still in my mouth.
A few hours later, I woke up to the blaring of my alarm. Groggy and disoriented, I realized her feet were still resting on my chest, inches from my face. The memory and humiliation of sucking and worshipping her feet all night came rushing back. I was a bit embarrassed that I had worshipped her so submissively without getting anything in return. I let her know I had to get ready for my interviews but told her she could stay and sleep in until 10:00 a.m. as long as she checked out of the room by 11:00. She gave a lazy nod, still half-asleep, and said that wouldn’t be a problem. I had to masturbate in the bathroom before heading to my interviews still so red with humiliation and turned-on by it as well. I was associating my orgasms with the rush of humiliation and it had taken my orgasms when masturbating to new heights. I was hooked on the feeling.
After the interviews that day, I let my director, Raul, know I was open to relocating to Houston for the higher pay and the opportunity to work in an outside sales role. However, he insisted I also visit Philadelphia before making a final decision. I agreed to check it out so, I flew to Philly and was greeted at the airport by a stunning sales representative named Lauren. She was tall, with a sultry East Coast accent that drew me in right away. I spent the day shadowing her as she made rounds to high-profile clients in the towering skyscrapers of Center City.
Lauren was impressive—sharp, efficient, and meticulous in her meetings. She even found a large new opportunity with a major motorcycle parts company, and watching her work, I couldn’t help but develop a bit of a crush. Beyond her beauty, her professional poise made me realize she’d be the perfect mentor, someone who could really help me grow into a top-tier sales rep. My potential territory would be just outside the heart of the city, but from what I saw, Philadelphia had a lot to offer.
After finishing our day together, I called Raul to let him know that I preferred Philadelphia over Houston. He said that he would prefer me there because he would be taking a position as the director of that sales territory, and my direct manager would be a budding superstar salesman out of New York City, who had regularly led the company in sales numbers. My role would essentially involve finding new opportunities and then bringing in my new manager, Rejesh, to seal the deals with decision-makers. I felt confident that finding new business would be a breeze, and I was eager for the challenge that lay ahead. With a bit of luck, I could flourish in my new sales role in the greater Philadelphia area and quickly climb the ladder to a National Account Manager position.
Raul told me to go out and get a feel for the rest of the city that night so I took a cab downtown after I got off the phone with him and rested for a couple of hours. My first stop was a quirky bar with dartboards and graffiti-covered walls called Dirty Franks. I ordered a pint of local IPA, enjoying the laid-back vibe before heading to my next destination—an Irish pub called Jimmy’s, just around the corner. As I walked in, I spotted a group of four men, probably ranging from their late 30s to mid-50s, laughing and joking around the bar. One of them, an older man from New Jersey, was playfully being teased as a mobster, with his friends joking that anyone who crossed him might just disappear.
They seemed like a fun bunch, so I offered to buy them a round of shots. But they waved me off, explaining they were celebrating a wedding and insisted on treating me instead. I joined them in their celebrations, and before long, I was several shots of Tullamore Dew and a couple of Guinness deep. We laughed, drank, and partied well into the night, and by the time it was over, I had completely fallen in love with the Philadelphia nightlife. The last thing I remember was raising a glass with them before everything went black.
I woke the next morning to my alarm blaring at 8:55 a.m. in a haze of confusion. My flight was at 10:15 a.m., and I was cutting it way too close. Still half-dazed, I rushed to pack and barely made it to the airport in time to catch my flight back to Arizona.
My director, Raul, informed me that Rejesh wanted to meet for an interview before finalizing my hiring, and if all went smoothly, I would soon be packing my bags, receiving a generous relocation allowance of $7,500, and embarking on an exciting new chapter in Philadelphia. 
They wanted to move quickly, so I would be flying out to Philadelphia just two days later. Rejesh would pick me up from the airport and take me back to the office, where we would conduct interviews throughout the day. To make the most of my visit, Raul decided I should shadow a coworker named Eric whom I had worked with on the inside sales team.  He was now in Baltimore doing sales within the same area and under the same manager as I would have. Raul thought that might give me a deeper insight into the East Coast operations and team dynamics and also help through making some additional connections.
Everything seemed to click during my interview with Rejesh, and I thoroughly enjoyed shadowing Eric the following day. After the workday ended, Eric, his girlfriend Jamie, and I went out with some of the Baltimore team for dinner and drinks. We hit several bars, laughing and bonding over shared stories, and I felt an instant camaraderie with everyone. I really liked the team, and my new manager, Rejesh, seemed like a good guy. Plus, with Eric and Jamie in Baltimore, I knew I would have friends nearby to visit in Baltimore—or they could come see me in Philadelphia. The future was shaping up to be quite exciting and I was ready for a bit of a change and to see what the next chapter of my life might hold.
When I returned to Phoenix, I quickly fired off an email to Raul, expressing my desire to accept the Philadelphia position if it was offered to me. To my excitement, he responded within the hour, informing me that my new salary would be $53,000, and they wanted me to relocate within two weeks. My last day at the Tempe office would be that Friday, giving me two full weeks to pack up my life and settle into Philadelphia. I would start my new role the Monday after the second weekend, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter.
Rajesh tried to convince me to ship my car, stating that it would significantly speed up my transition and allow me to start sooner. But I was determined to drive out myself, craving the chance to explore along the way and savor the two weeks off from the daily grind of work. “Everyone else has taken advantage of their time off to move, so why shouldn’t I?” I reasoned, excited at the prospect of a little adventure.
Plus, driving would allow me to save a chunk of my $7,500 relocation bonus for essentials like rent, bedroom furnishings, and a little bit of fun once I got settled in. The thought of hitting the open road, soaking in the sights, and embarking on this new journey fueled my excitement even further.
I was popular both at the office and among my college friends in Tempe, so they decided to throw me a going-away party before my big move to Philadelphia. We settled on Cue Club, the pool hall bar in Tempe, and everyone came out to send me off in style. Our favorite bartenders, Samantha and Lindsey—both absolute stunners from ASU—were serving us that night, which made the evening even better. I felt pretty loved.
My friend Ash showed up, and since he wasn’t working at the time, he offered to help with the drive from Phoenix to Philly if I covered his flight back home. I thought it was a great idea. Having him along to split the driving shifts would help us make better time and also have someone to talk to on the cross-country trip sounded great.
That night in Tempe was unforgettable—full of laughter, goodbyes, and a sense of excitement for the next chapter of my life.
Towards the end of the night Lauren and I decided to get a hotel room in Tempe for one last romantic night together. We started making out as soon as we entered the room, and I pressed her up against the wall. Unfortunately, I had drank too much and couldn't get hard. Determined to please her, I went down on her with her lying on her back and after a few minutes she teasingly asked, "Do you want me to sit on your face?" Her sitting on my face had become a ritual in our relationship. I think that she enjoyed feeling dominant over her boyfriend, and of course I loved feeling sexually submissive to her with her pussy pressing down on my lips while she stared down at me. That was probably the main issue with our relationship. She gained too much power and relished the way she could manipulate me to do whatever she wanted.
"Yes, baby," I replied, and she straddled my stomach, slowly working her way up until her juicy pussy met my lips. I grabbed her hips, pulling her closer, loving the sensation of tasting her. That always got me going. In that position, my arousal quickly returned. Sometimes she'd even pin my hands down with her knees, teasing me until she was fully satisfied. It was her way of taking control, and it never failed to drive me wild. After a few minutes of her riding my face, I was rock hard again. She shifted and began riding my dick, but the experience wasn’t quite the same. Sex with her had gotten a bit boring, and I almost preferred being pinned down beneath her, lost in the fantasy that had become a part of our sex life.
In the beginning, simple missionary was enough to make things feel electric, but by now, my mind had wandered into kinkier fantasies. Only then could I finish, feeding off that twisted mix of desire and submission.
We still weren’t together and the night was classified more as a hook-up than a rekindling. I was already excited about the move to Philadelphia—ready to explore new opportunities and meet other women. Finally, I felt like I was escaping the rut I had been stuck in for so long.
A couple of days after the farewell party, I loaded up my trusty Prius with my most essential belongings, ready to embark on a new adventure. As I hugged my parents goodbye, they presented me with a heartfelt card featuring the words "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" to celebrate this exciting new chapter in my life. Inside, they had penned touching messages, filled with encouragement and well wishes for my journey ahead.
Having moved to Sun City, Arizona, after retiring two years ago, my parents had settled into a quieter lifestyle to be closer to me post-college. My mom, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2009, faced significant challenges in getting around and was often in pain. Despite this, she and my dad, Josh, seemed content as homebodies in their sunny oasis. At 56 and 59 years old, respectively, it felt fitting for them to embrace a slower pace of life. They appeared to enjoy their serene existence, supported by my mom’s disability income and my dad's retirement savings. With their house bought outright by my grandmother, they seemed set for the future, living comfortably without financial stress.
The night before my departure for Philadelphia, I went to Tempe for one last bittersweet goodbye with Lauren. I enveloped her in a warm hug, kissing her with a mix of love and lingering uncertainty. While I was still deeply attached, having invested so much time, money, and emotion into our connection, it seemed like she was drifting away. The intimacy of our farewell made saying goodbye even more challenging. We eventually parted ways, both of us aware that this moment marked a significant turning point.
The next morning I loaded up the car and set off to pick up Ash from his apartment in Tempe, eager to kick off our journey to Philadelphia. Our adventure had a lively itinerary: a visit to Austin to see my friend Stephanie from Laura’s sorority in college, a leisurely two-day stop in Nashville, and possibly another major East Coast city before making our way up the coast to Philly.
After about 14 hours on the road, we finally arrived at Stephanie’s apartment in Austin. She still looked stunning—with the same infectious smile and a soothing voice that could charm anyone. We went out with some of her friends in downtown Austin for a few drinks, effortlessly slipping back into our rhythm as we caught up and shared laughter throughout the night. She was the kind of friend you could reconnect with seamlessly, skipping past any awkwardness as if no time had passed at all.
The next morning, Ash and I set off for Nashville, a city we had both been eagerly anticipating. The drive from Austin to Nashville stretched over thirteen hours, with the threat of snowfall looming on the horizon. We took turns behind the wheel in two-and-a-half-hour increments, each of us buzzing with excitement for the adventure ahead. We rolled into Nashville late, around 10:00 PM, yet adrenaline still coursed through our veins. As we navigated through the city, passing the vibrant bars that lined the streets, we could feel the energy rising around us. The lively nightlife summoned us, promising a night of unforgettable fun.
Ash was particularly excited about the live music scene; he had played guitar his entire life and had become quite skilled. Back in junior high, after being grounded for an entire summer, he had been given only one privilege: to play his guitar. That enforced isolation turned out to be a fast track to mastery, and he had developed the talent of a seasoned lead guitarist, fit for any band. Ash was contemplating a move to Nashville, depending on how our trip went.
We hopped into a cab from our hotel and headed straight for Broadway, enthusiastic to dive into the live music and soak in the atmosphere. For those who don’t know, Nashville is known as the Bachelorette Party capital of the United States, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. The main strip was packed with gorgeous women in cowboy boots, though being winter, many opted for pearl snap shirts and jeans instead of cut off shorts like all the songs. Damn, they were stunning. I couldn’t help but think it was even better than Scottsdale. It felt like a mini-Vegas, minus the gambling, with live music spilling from every corner. “This is the best party city I’ve ever been to, aside from maybe Las Vegas,” Ash declared, and I agreed.
After our exciting first night, we decided to dive into round two and extend our hotel stay for another night. Ash was eager to explore more bars, seeking potential venues where he could showcase his talent if he chose to make Nashville his new home. Meanwhile, I was simply excited to keep the party going. We allowed ourselves a leisurely morning; the trip and long drive had finally caught up with us. Night two was a lot of fun too, but by then, Ash was starting to feel a bit worn out from my partying.
The following morning, we hit the road early, determined to reach Philadelphia by nightfall. This would give us Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to enjoy the city before Ash's flight home on Sunday night. 
As I began the drive toward Philadelphia, the radio warned of potential snowstorms in eastern Tennessee and up through the Baltimore/Washington D.C. area. We checked the radar and it looked like we would be driving straight into it for at least a couple of hours. We met the edge of the snowfall near Knoxville, but managed to push through, maintaining our momentum.
As we approached Richmond, we encountered yet another wave of snow, this time thick and heavy, significantly slowing down traffic and hindering our progress. By the time we finally navigated through the city, it was already past 8:00 PM, and we were crawling along the highway at a sluggish 20-25 mph. Exhausted from the relentless traffic and the long drive, we pressed onward toward Washington D.C. The snow swirled around us like a scene from a movie. Turning to Ash, I asked, “Do you want to just stay in D.C. for the night and drive the rest of the way up tomorrow?” He nodded in agreement, and I quickly pulled up Orbitz to find a budget-friendly hotel near the busy part of D.C. We finally arrived at the hotel around 10:45 PM. Ash was exhausted and opted to hit the hay right away, while I couldn’t resist heading out to a bar to check out the girls and have a couple drinks before I went to sleep. 
The following morning, we woke up to a melting landscape, the snow having vanished overnight. We hit the road around 1:30 PM, but the remains of the snowfall made for shaky driving conditions. It wasn’t until just after 7:00 PM that we finally arrived in Philadelphia. A guy named Bill answered the door—a friendly figure standing about 5'11" with blue eyes and sandy blonde hair cut in a neat crew cut. He had a kind face, though his slightly heavyset frame suggested he enjoyed a good meal.
Within moments, the other two roommates, Alex and Ian, shuffled into the room. “Good to meet you all! I can grab some beers if anyone is in the mood,” I offered. An awkward silence fell over them as they exchanged glances, trying to find the right words to deliver some disappointing news. Finally, Ian broke the silence, “Well, actually, here in Philadelphia, you can’t buy beer right now. It’s Sunday, and they only sell it at dispensaries, which are already closed for the day. So, if you want to drink, you will need to hit up a bar.”
My face must have shown some of my disappointment, but I quickly covered it up, suggesting we check out a nearby bar. With a sense of adventure still buzzing through me—I didn’t have to work for another week—I whipped out my phone to Google the area. The new roommates agreed to join me for a bit, though they mentioned they couldn’t stay out too late since they had work in the morning.
We strolled down to a nearby dive bar just about a block and a half away, and it felt like the perfect spot. It had everything: dartboards, a gorgeous bartender, touch tunes for music, grimy single-person restrooms, and to top it all off, incredible pub fries. I knew I’d be a regular there. Ian, the tallest of the roommates at 6’2”, had a girlfriend named Marly, whom he brought along. She was a petite 5’5” blonde with piercing blue eyes—a total knockout. Plus, she was feisty, and I loved that. Bantering back and forth was one of my favorite pastimes, and she was someone I could spar with.
Ian exuded a relaxed California vibe, having relocated from Seattle to take an engineering role at a large defense company in the area. With his sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, he was the quintessential embodiment of that effortless California cool.
Unfortunately, as charismatic as my roommates and their friends were, my boss turned out to be a total jerk. My Mondays through Fridays quickly spiraled into a nightmare once I started working for him. On my very first day, before I even had a chance to set up my laptop, he came out of his office, handed me a list of customers, and barked, “Hey Jake, here’s your customer list. Set up four meetings this afternoon, and I’ll go with you to meet them.” Without so much as a smile or a nod, he retreated to his office, leaving me stunned. “What the hell?” I thought. I had just met Rajesh for the second time, had no prior field sales experience, and was already feeling the jitters.
I had expected a bit of a ramp-up period—maybe a chance to familiarize myself with the companies in my territory, to reach out via email or phone, and to set up in-person meetings within a week or two. But no, it was sink or swim from the get-go. I managed to schedule three meetings for that afternoon, but Rajesh wasn’t satisfied. I quickly learned that he was never satisfied.
I lived in Manayunk, nestled on the far northeast edge of Philadelphia, while my office was located at the Philadelphia airport, in the far southeast corner of the city. My sales territory stretched back toward Manayunk and beyond, a solid fifteen-minute drive from where I had chosen to live. I had moved to that neighborhood specifically for its proximity to my sales territory, but that intelligence was ruined immediately by Rajesh’s ridiculous demands.
He made us all drive into the office every day before 8:00 AM, just to report to him. After that, I would have to make the trek back past where I lived, then head out to my sales territory. It wasn’t like I was doing anything productive in the office; he simply wanted to ensure we checked in with him so he could apply any additional pressure he deemed necessary. It didn’t matter how miserable the weather was—his rule was crystal clear: show up at the office every single morning by 8:00 AM, only to drive back out to my territory.
This madness forced me to wake up at the ungodly hour of 5:50 AM to shower, eat, and get ready for the day, sprint out the door by 6:50 AM, and endure a full hour-long commute to the office. Then, I’d have to turn around, get right back into my car and drive for another grueling hour-and-a-half to two-hour trek back out to my sales territory. It was pure insanity! The inefficiency of it all drove me absolutely nuts. Had I known that every single day would start at the airport office, I would have reconsidered my choice to live in Manayunk, or my choice to take the position at all.
With this uncompromising schedule, I couldn’t even make it to my territory until around 10:15 AM. By that time, I was already drained from two and a half hours of driving and seething with frustration about the entire ordeal—every. single. day. I tried to schedule around it and hunt for new opportunities with companies that hadn’t previously used us for shipping, but honestly, every place I walked into seemed to despise us. If they had ever used our services, it was usually because we had delivered incredibly shoddy work or demanded exorbitant fees for past shipments, leading them to swear off any future dealings. The few clients that did still use us relied on us for only select shipments; they wouldn’t consider us for others because we were just too pricey.
Philadelphia wasn’t exactly the vibrant metropolis of Los Angeles or New York; it felt like an aging, perhaps even dying city. I found myself utterly miserable in this role, and my boss was doing nothing to help. Rajesh was a relentless presence, constantly pressing me for updates on every little detail. It felt like I was suffocating under his scrutiny. I often wished I had taken that job in Houston instead.
Lauren and I had gotten entangled back into talking and trying to make a long-distance relationship work. I guess she didn’t realize how much of a stable force I was in her life until I was gone, so she would still want to talk nearly every night on the phone to discuss our lives and see if we could rekindle a relationship. I was relieved to have the distance between us because it meant I was no longer paying for every dinner or every bar tab when we went out. 
She had visited me for St. Patrick’s Day weekend, which I thought would be a romantic trip, but not only did we not have sex, but she also seemed to act more like a distant friend than a girlfriend—a distant friend that wasn’t even that fun. My roommates all loathed her. She came off as pretentious and a bit cold, though I suspected she was just nervous and didn’t want to lead me on if her feelings had changed. Maybe when she saw me in person again she realized that the spark was gone and to just try to let everything die. I was determined to pursue her as I had invested so much into the relationship and if she was giving me a hint of a chance at rekindling things, I was going to take it. I think that with my job as chaotic as it was, she was the one thing, besides my mom, that gave me some sense of stability. They were the only people that I’d share my stressors with and I needed some sort of an outlet with all of the stress Rajesh was attaching to the job.
It was difficult to make new friends in Philadelphia. Most of the people there had grown up there their entire lives and weren’t interested in making new friends. I was usually capable of charming groups of people for a night at a time out at the bars to have fun nights with random people, but it seldomly ended up in even exchanging phone numbers, let along developing any sort of a meaningful friendship. My roommates were also homebodies for the most part which didn’t help.
By April, Philadelphia was still grappling with frigid temperatures dipping to a bone-chilling 27 degrees. That was just the cherry on top of my misery. I couldn’t even indulge in my dissatisfaction with pleasant weather; it had to be dismal all around me. The driving alone made it feel like I was clocking in twelve to fourteen hours a day, compounded by the suffocating pressure, stress, and those late-night phone calls from Rajesh.  
All I needed to do was endure nine more months of this hell, and then I’d be free from repaying my relocation bonus. That $7,500 was the sole anchor keeping me from quitting right then and there. If I could have marched out the door at that moment, I would have; but the grim reality was that I hadn’t made or saved much money yet.
As summer rolled into fall, my relationship with Lauren was still rocky and uncertain. On a positive note, Lauren encouraged me to connect with her friend Zack, a Harvard-educated lawyer living in Washington, D.C. I thought it was a great idea and asked her to set up the introduction. Zack soon texted me, inviting me down to hang out with him in a couple of weeks. I was desperate for an East Coast friend, so I jumped at the opportunity. The drive down was a manageable 2 ½ hours, but just the thought of seeing a familiar face—someone I always enjoyed being around in group settings—felt like a much-needed boost.
That first weekend in Washington, D.C., turned out to be incredible. Zack and I hit it off like old pals. He was charming and effortlessly kept up with my energy, standing at a handsome 5’11” with striking blue eyes and light brown hair. His infectious smile and magnetic personality made him a chick magnet, and I loved being the master of getting my friends laid. By the end of the weekend, I had helped him score not once, but twice.
Zack genuinely enjoyed my company; I was a refreshing burst of fun and energy compared to the more buttoned-up lawyers he typically associated with. He had a close-knit circle of fellow attorneys we’d occasionally join for nights out, but we always found that our most memorable adventures happened when it was just the two of us, prowling the D.C. nightlife in search of ladies to charm.
There was a satisfying thrill in helping Zack score with women he might not have otherwise approached, so I was more than happy to keep the momentum going. We started hanging out at least once a month, a welcome reprieve from the repetitiveness of our lives. Both of us were feeling a little unhappy with our weeknight lives on the East Coast, and we shared a common goal of making our way back to the Phoenix area.
As June approached, my roommates and my lease was about to expire, but we all wanted to continue living together. So, we began the search for a new place, aiming for a location closer to the city that would also offer a wealthier and potentially more vibrant neighborhood. Manayunk was fun for what it was, but it was a real journey to get into the city from the location we were in. We wanted to be closer to the action. I thought maybe this would help us all get out together more often as well. The promise of better weather during the summer was a welcome change too. The winter was frigid, and I hadn’t experienced one in nearly a decade, and with the depression of work and Lauren on top of it, it was a little difficult to try to be happy at all.
We ended up finding a great row home in Fairmount that had four bedrooms across three stories, complete with a basement. The basement and the top floor each had bedrooms of their own, and both Bill and Alex eagerly claimed those spaces as they were the largest spaces.
On the second floor were two bedrooms and a shared bathroom, with one room significantly smaller than the other. I decided to negotiate for the smaller bedroom, figuring I could snag a great deal while still living in a prime Philly neighborhood. Ian, still in his relationship with Marly, opted for the larger of the two rooms to accommodate her visits. When the dust settled, I was thrilled to find that my monthly rent would be just $175 for the next twelve months. That left me with plenty of cash to spend on nights out at the bars to figure out how to try to turn my experience for the better. The rent was also low enough that if I decided to leave and head back to Arizona before our lease was up, I could easily manage the cost.
As the move to Fairmount progressed and Lauren continued to voice her uncertainty about our relationship in nearly every conversation, I decided it was time to explore what else was out there. A new phone app called “Tinder” had just burst onto the scene, offering users the chance to match with members of their preferred gender and initiate conversations that could lead to dates. To my surprise and delight, I found myself receiving a wealth of interest from attractive women through the app. I started going on a few dates, taking one girl to a Phillies game, another to a Dave Matthews Band concert in Camden, and gearing up for a highly anticipated night on August 13th at the Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake concert at Citizens Bank Park in South Philly with another.
The atmosphere at the concert was electric on August 13th, filled with anticipation and pulsating music, when I noticed my phone buzzing with a call from my mom. I didn’t pick up because it wasn’t an environment where I’d even be able to hear her, but moments later, a text popped up on my screen: “Jake, give me a call when you get this. I have some bad news.” My heart sank. “What else could be going wrong,” I wondered. I told my date I needed to step out for a moment and made my way to a quieter corner to call my mom back.
When she answered, her voice trembled slightly. “Hey Jake, I’m sorry to interrupt your fun, but your grandma has taken a turn for the worse. She’s no longer able to speak, and we’ve started hospice care at home. We set up a hospital bed in the living room, so she’s here with us, but she doesn’t have much time left. If you want to visit her one last time, your dad and I will buy your plane ticket to fly back.”
I felt a rush of emotions. I had never been particularly close to my grandma, but I cared for her deeply; she was family. It felt important to see her and offer comfort during this time, especially since we had never shared that close of a bond. I promised my mom I’d talk to my manager, Rajesh, to see if I could get the time off.
Trying to enjoy the rest of the concert with my date proved challenging. The information weighed down my thoughts.
The next morning, I sent Rajesh an email requesting to fly out on Friday to spend the weekend back in Arizona with my dying grandma. He swiftly approved the time off, and I called my mom to ask her to book my plane ticket. I was also thrilled at the prospect of seeing her again, as I missed her dearly. I missed my dad too and looked forward to spending time with him as well. Plus, I hoped to drive down to Tempe one night to catch up with some of my college friends.
The trip ended up being as good as could be expected. It was odd to just see my grandma lying mute in a hospital bed in the middle of the living room while we tried our best to comfort her with words and touch. It was nice to get back and be able to spend some time with my mom. I didn’t realize how much I missed her and how much just being around her seemed to be able to life me up. 
My grandma was expected to pass relatively soon after my visit. She held on longer than anyone anticipated, but sadly she passed away in early September. Since we were the only ones left who had been close to her at the end of her life, there wasn’t a funeral or gathering, making it feel like a quiet farewell.
After dealing with my grandma’s final arrangements, my parents were scheduled to embark on a cruise on October 12th to Mexico for my mom’s birthday.  Meanwhile, Lauren and I had plans to vacation in Belize together just before that in the middle of September. I looked forward to this getaway, hoping it would either breathe new life into our relationship or serve as a clear reason to finally break up for good, allowing me to pursue other women more aggressively in Philadelphia. Although I had been going on dates and sharing a few kisses, I hesitated to take things further since I was still trying to rekindle the relationship with Lauren.
Finally, the week of our trip arrived, and I was eager to step away from my boss’s relentless pressure and see where Lauren and I stood. Unfortunately, the vacation ended up raising more questions than providing answers. It felt like the beginning of the end for me; if she remained so uncertain about our relationship, I wasn’t going to continue being loyal and committed to her. I craved fun and wanted to explore whether other girls were interested in me.
A little less than a month after our trip to Belize, my parents were set to drive out to Los Angeles for their cruise to celebrate my mom's birthday. I can still picture my mother in her vibrant yellow shirt, wheelchair-bound, beaming with excitement as she prepared to board the ship. I hadn’t seen her smile that broadly in years. She seemed so excited to be getting out to experience life not being couped up in a house with my dad in Sun City. I was a bit surprised because when I had suggested and prodded for them to do more things they always had resisted.
My sister had gifted them the cruise tickets as a birthday present for my mom which was a surprise to us all. Their relationship had been strained for years, and they’d hardly spoken over the past five. My mom had struggled with substance abuse issues related to the medication prescribed for her multiple sclerosis. She would shop around for doctors, collecting pills that left her loopy to the point of slurring her words and often barely able to stay awake. I remember many evenings spent driving from the house I was living at in Tempe to their house in Sun City, Arizona, trying to help manage the situation when my dad seemed overwhelmed.
There was a time when she confided in the wrong doctor about her dark thoughts, revealing moments of vulnerability that led to a week-long stay in a mental health facility. Visiting her at the mental health facility was difficult, a reminder of the battles we faced. I watched as my mother’s health deteriorated alarmingly between 2006 and 2009. The combination of her chronic illness and escalating prescription drug use spiraled further out of control after they moved to Kentucky from 2009 to 2011. Eventually, when my dad, Josh, lost his job in Kentucky, they relocated to Arizona, seeking the solace of retirement in a golf course home in Sun City.
I won’t lie; I felt a twinge of excitement in the lead up to my parents’ cruise. Since it was international, their phones would lose service after the first day, giving me a much-needed rest from our nightly check-ins. I was used to those calls, where I reassured her that everything was fine and shared snippets of my life, which she always seemed to cherish. Really, most of the time, I just wanted to speak to her to make sure she wasn’t slurring her words and delirious from the drugs she was abusing. This brief break felt like a breath of fresh air. Plus, with my secretive plans to move back to Arizona soon, I wasn’t overly concerned about work so I could enjoy the time off of checking in on her and try to have a little fun at the same time.
The Saturday after my parents set sail, I decided to embrace spontaneity and dive headfirst into a whirlwind of fun. Eric and Jamie were in town for the weekend from Baltimore, and we made our way to Xfinity Live!, a pulsating bar hub nestled near the stadiums. With my relationship with Lauren having fizzled out, Eric and Jamie wasted no time making connections with a couple of charming girls who caught our attention amidst the lively crowd. Our day was a delightful mix of laughter, drinks, and flirtation, and after several hours of festivities, we retreated to my apartment, where the night took a fun turn.
As we continued to drink back at my apartment one of the girls that came back with us captured my attention. Standing at 5’5”, she had straight brunette hair that framed her face beautifully and a very nice body. She also radiated an irresistible sexual confidence that drew me in like a magnet.
After a couple more beers at my place, the girl I had taken an interest in and I made our way upstairs to my bedroom, the door closing softly behind us. She looked at me with a playful smile and asked what I wanted to do. With the thrill of the moment with her being the first new girl I was going to be hooking up with in about six years, I suggested we make out and see where the night would lead. Overwhelmed by desire to experience something sexual with someone new I wasted no time making my move.
She had already taken her shoes off before we got on the bed and started making out. She was wearing tight jeans, and I slowly unbuttoned them, and slid them down off her sexy legs. The anticipation was intense; she was already wet from my fingers teasing her pussy. I peeled off her red panties, eager to get to work. But as soon as I got closer, I caught the unmistakable scent—she was filled with someone else's semen. Clearly, she hadn't bothered to clean up after a recent encounter with another guy.
The smell hit me immediately, fishy and strong, but instead of being turned off, I felt a surge of humiliation and arousal. I was already committed, my face inches away from her, so I pushed forward, sliding my tongue into her. The mix of her taste and his was jarring at first, but the more I dived in, the easier it became to tolerate. She grabbed the back of my head, pressing my face into her dirty pussy, knowing she had complete control. The realization that she didn’t even respect me enough to clean up first only added to the intense mix of shame and desire I was feeling. I could only imagine what she was thinking about the loser that was licking another guys cum out of her.
When I finally pulled away, my face slick with their combined juices, I excused myself to the bathroom. After a quick piss, I returned to find her and her friend getting ready to leave. No hand job, no return on my efforts—just the lingering sense of being used. It was both disappointing and incredibly hot. I felt dirty, with their combined fluids drying on my face, and somehow, that was enough for me. The thought of what had just happened would fuel countless fantasies, knowing I had been made to clean her slutty, cum filled, perfect pussy after she'd been with someone else. The sense of humiliation was scorching.
The next day, Eric, Jamie, and I ventured to a lively bar in Fairmount called Bishop’s Collar. We settled in for an epic day of day drinking while soaking up the excitement of college football. By the time the weekend wrapped up, I felt rejuvenated and ready to tackle the workweek ahead. I had managed to hook up with a girl—sort of—and had an unforgettable weekend filled with a lot of fun.
Monday morning arrived, and I strolled into the office at the airport at 7:45 AM, dressed in a crisp dress shirt and slacks. As the meeting kicked off, my boss, Rajesh, launched into his presentation. About five minutes in, he suddenly halted, casting a critical eye my way. “Really? No tie, man? Wow. Do you have one in your car that you can put on? This is very disrespectful,” he scolded.
I felt my frustration bubble to the surface. I was already fed up with his antics, but I didn’t want to jeopardize my job. My plan was simply to endure until my year was up and then make my exit. As Rajesh continued to speak, I shrank in my seat, feeling as small and exposed as possible. Embarrassment washed over me, simmering into an anger. In a moment of dark humor, I found myself fantasizing about how I might get away with killing Rajesh. The thought was absurd (I’d never do it!), yet it oddly comforted me. “Sure, you can be a jerk to me. But just know, I could always take you out if I really wanted to,” I mused, relishing my fleeting sense of power.
Lost in my vengeful daydreams, I was abruptly jolted back to reality by the sharp snap of fingers. Rajesh was attempting to reclaim my attention. “Alright, everyone, I think we’re all tired. You’re free to go,” he declared, dismissing us with an nonchalant wave.
Despite the humiliation I felt from my boss’s patronizing behavior, I managed to say goodbye to my co-workers, but I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge Rajesh. I climbed into my car and drove back to my Fairmount home, determined to drown my frustrations in alcohol. The plan was simple: I would get as drunk as possible, hoping to forget the whole experience and numb the lingering embarrassment. I hit up Bishop's Collar in Fairmount, where I downed seven pints and four shots in a blur.
Around 12:30 AM, I finally decided it was time to call it a night and sleep it off, so I could be somewhat functional before heading out to my sales territory later in the morning. Thankfully, the Area Manager had caught wind of Rajesh's absurd demand for everyone to report to the office before 8:00 AM and had overruled him. The nightmare of those early mornings was finally over.
On most workdays, I didn’t expect to hear from Rajesh until 10:00 or 11:00 AM, so I would frequently sneak in an extra hour or two of drinking the night before and then sleep in a little bit. After the way I had been singled out in the meeting, I decided to drink a little more than usual and enjoy a couple more hours of sleep. At that point, I didn’t care anymore; if they caught me and fired me, so be it.
The next morning, I awoke to a barrage of missed calls—one from Rajesh on my work phone and another from my sister on my personal phone, which struck me as odd. Realizing it was already 10:30 AM, I jumped into the shower and threw on some work clothes, preparing to head out to my territory. Deciding to call my sister back, I braced myself for whatever news she had.
When she answered, her voice was thick with sobs. “What happened?!?” I asked, my heart racing. “You know,” she replied cryptically. In moments like that, you don’t know anything. “No, Kate. I don’t know. Please tell me,” I urged.
“Mom died,” she said.
“Oh, fuck. Oh my god. Are you serious? What happened?” I stammered, my heart racing as panic washed over me. Kate could only tell me that Mom had passed away on the cruise ship sometime during the previous night. To make matters worse, my dad hadn’t even bothered to call me.
I felt completely shattered. Just a month earlier, my grandma had died, and now my mom was gone too. A crushing wave of self-hatred engulfed me as I cursed my decision to move to Philadelphia, convinced that if I had stayed in Arizona, things would have turned out differently. “Will Dad be calling me?” I asked. She didn’t know, explaining that he wouldn’t have access to their cell phones while on the international cruise. Still, she promised to let him know I wanted him to call if he reached out to her again.
In an effort to keep my boss off my back, I called him to break the news. He listened attentively, understanding the gravity of the situation. After asking a few questions about what had happened, he assured me that I had the day off and likely the next as well. His sincere condolences felt oddly comforting, especially coming from him. For once, he sounded more like a compassionate human being than a dictatorial boss.
As I hung up the phone, a wave of grief washed over me. I sank onto my bed, desperately trying to summon tears, but something felt off; they just wouldn’t come. I couldn't just continue to sit at home alone. I needed to do something to try to distract myself from the horror of my life. Nothing seemed real.
I decided to venture out to the grocery store. I mindlessly picked up a few items I didn’t really need. Then I spotted a Redbox kiosk. I rented a couple of movies, desiring a temporary escape from the crushing reality of my loss.
I texted Lauren and my friend Stephanie to inform them of my mom’s passing, asking if we could chat when they had a moment. Lauren called almost immediately; her voice tinged with an unsettling excitement. “I had a bad feeling that something was going to happen!” she declared, sounding like a detective who had just cracked a case. My stomach churned in disgust; this wasn’t the time for her to flaunt her ego. “How could she be so insensitive when I needed her the most?” I thought. 
Stephanie called about ten minutes later, her tone sympathetic and genuinely warm. It was a relief to talk to her, and I found myself thinking how fortunate I was to have her in my life. 
Returning home, I felt a growing anxiety about my inability to cry. I was sad; I loved my mom deeply, yet the tears refused to flow. I realized that it had been years since I had cried. In a moment of clarity, I posted a heartfelt message on Facebook to commemorate my mother’s life and to notify friends and family of her passing. Almost immediately, messages flooded in—people shared their fondest memories of her, their heartfelt condolences, and prayers. “It’s nice to feel like people care,” I thought.
My roommates, having seen my heartfelt post, mentioned they were heading out to a haunted house that night. They hesitated, sensing that it might not be the best plan for me but urged me to join if I felt up to it. I thought it would be a good idea to get out of the house and keep my mind occupied so I accepted and went with them.
We made our way to the haunted house at the old Eastern State Penitentiary in Fairmount. It was a a welcome distraction from the weight of my mom's passing. However, whenever I caught myself laughing or losing my grief through distraction, a pang of guilt would wash over me, as if I were betraying her memory by allowing myself to enjoy the moment. After the haunted house, we headed to Bishop's Collar for a nightcap. They had cautioned me against drinking, and I agreed, choosing to stay sober that night.
While at the bar, I met a girl who was clearly intoxicated. Despite my situation, I kept the conversation light and friendly. She lived just around the corner, and when I offered to walk her home, she gratefully accepted, clearly too tipsy to navigate the streets alone. She stumbled across the street with me holding her up, and when we reached her front door, we exchanged pleasantries and shared a quick hug. As tempting as it was to ask for her number, I held back. With just losing my mom I wasn’t ready for anything at the moment.  It was hard enough to just put one foot in front of the other and keep moving forward at that point.
On the walk back to my house I took my time letting my senses to take in the details of my surroundings. I focused on the places along the street that I had previously overlooked. As I passed the Corinthian Gardens next to the prison, I paused to appreciate its unexpected beauty.
Once home, I took some sleeping medication, hoping it would help me get a little bit of sleep. However, sleep eluded me, and I was jolted awake the next morning by my phone ringing at 10:00 a.m. The number on the screen looked unfamiliar, but I answered it anyway, hoping that it was my dad calling from the cruise ship. To my relief, it was him.
“Hey Jake, it’s your father. I have some sad news—as you know your mother passed away yesterday in her sleep on the cruise,” he said, his voice heavy with sorrow. “I’m okay, but obviously sad. They’ve taken her body to the morgue on the ship. They aren’t fully sure what happened, but they’ll perform a complete autopsy when we get back to Los Angeles. How are you holding up?”
It was hard to come up with words. “How the hell am I doing?” raced through my mind, but I held my tongue. Instead, I replied, “I’m okay. I mean, obviously sad, but I don’t know if it’s fully hit me yet.”
My dad said he understood the struggle I was going through with it not hitting me yet. Unfortunately, he had limited time on the phone because they were out at sea and the call was international. “I love you,” he said, and as quickly as that, he had to end the conversation.
“Okay, love you too,” I responded, and just like that, the call was over.
My dad still had four days left on the cruise, with their destination city in Mexico approaching. They were set to dock there for the day tomorrow before heading back to Los Angeles. I couldn’t fathom how awful that must be: losing your wife and then being trapped on a ship with her lifeless body while surrounded by oblivious celebrators. It seemed worse than hell itself.
That afternoon, I discovered that the Corinthian Gardens I had passed the night before was hosting a planting event, and it struck me as a emotional tribute to volunteer, helping to plant new flowers in their garden plots in memory of my mom. I spent the day on my feet, assisting fellow volunteers and fetching water, feeling a bit of purpose amidst the overwhelming feeling of grief. There was even a sweepstakes drawing for those who helped, with the winner receiving their own flower plot to name. I hoped to win so I could dedicate it to my mom, but it wasn’t in the cards and my name wasn’t drawn.
My boss had given me the rest of the week off, but he did want to grab lunch nearby after a couple of days to check in on me. He was the last person I wanted to see, yet the prospect of a free meal with my dwindling bank account was tempting, and I thought it might earn me some goodwill which I desperately needed. We settled on an Indian restaurant not too far from where I lived, and conveniently close to Rajesh's office.
It was my first experience with Indian cuisine, and Rajesh recommended the masala—either lamb or chicken for a newbie. As we sat and ate, the atmosphere felt different; we spoke far less than usual. Typically, Rajesh bombarded me with endless questions, but today he seemed genuinely concerned about my situation, almost hesitant to intrude on my emotions. Perhaps he still felt guilty for the way he had treated me in that meeting right before my mom passed away.
At one point, he asked if I planned to fly back to Los Angeles to see my mom one last time after they returned. I found the question bizarre. “Who would want to see one of their parents a week after they had died?” I thought. The idea felt gross and morbid to me. I imagined her not looking like herself at all—motionless, lifeless. It was a vision I was sure that I’d rather avoid, but I told him I would think about it.
Truthfully, I had no idea where I would find the money to fly back to Illinois for the funeral. My finances had been consumed by nights of drinking and getting tangled up in “financial domination” with two girls from college. The weight of it all felt suffocating.
I was drawn to female domination, particularly a niche fetish known as “financial domination,” where a woman wields personal information and sometimes blackmail material over her male subjects to extort money through sexual humiliation. The girls I was doing it with knew I enjoyed being submissive, and they played along with my desires. I’d often ask them to call me their “bitch,” a title that made me feel extremely submissive to them. I found them to be a safer avenue to explore this fantasy with than a professional. We had a history and they knew me personally, which meant we could indulge in our desires but could also hit the brakes if things got too intense.
One of these girls was Victoria, a stunning blonde bombshell from Texas, standing tall at 5’7” with a long, slender frame, captivating blue eyes, and the kind of body that could grace any magazine cover. We had attended ASU at the same time and been introduced to each other a few times at events. We even had a picture together tagged on Facebook from a social where we were both talking for awhile. She had been crowned Miss Arizona several years ago, her beauty nothing short of breathtaking. At the time, she was dating a promising young baseball player in Triple-A, a hitter who seemed destined for the big leagues. If you’ve kept your ear to the ground in Major League Baseball over the past decade, you’d likely recognize his name. 
One drunken night just before moving to Philadelphia I had messaged her asking if she would financially dominate me.  What that meant was that I would send her a weekly amount of money in exchange for her not to tell Lauren or anyone else that I enjoyed being used and humiliated in this fashion. It quickly developed into her taking a very dominant role in the relationship and making me kneel in a tiny closet that was in my bedroom for hours at a time any time she thought I wasn’t being completely submissive to her.
In one of our more intense interactions, she had made me pick out and buy her an expensive set of Victoria’s Secret lingerie. Then, in a twist of domination that left me both exhilarated and humiliated, she instructed me to kneel in a closet, sending her video proof of my submission as she wore the very lingerie I had purchased for her while she fucked her boyfriend. I had given her my boss’s contact information as well as Lauren’s so she could force me to do any humiliating thing she wanted whenever she wanted.  I wasn’t allowed to say no to her and always had to submit to her when she would make a humiliation demand. I secretly loved it. The orgasms I would get over her treating me like her little bitch boy were incredible. The power dynamic between us blurred lines in ways I never expected intertwining pleasure and emotional pain in a surreal dance of control.
I had a particular fascination with cuckolding, and the combination of sexual teasing and humiliation from a girl as stunning as Victoria sent shivers down my spine. It was an intoxicating mix of degradation and desire, making my blood boil with a potent cocktail of shame and arousal. I fantasized in the thought of her boyfriend fucking her in the very lingerie I had bought for her, my heart racing as I knelt in the cramped closet like a devoted little servant.
By the end, I was cramping and sweating, the air conditioning in that tiny closet nothing more than a cruel joke. It felt more like an attic space with how hot it got in it. Finally, she let me know they were finished, and when I was allowed to emerge, she laid down a heavy ultimatum: I had to send her an extra $100, or she would unleash the videos and story of my submission to Lauren and my boss. I complied, knowing that the humiliation only heightened my desire; her playful taunts and extra demands to enforce my submission were all part of the thrill.
I tried to get out of the agreement about a month before my mom’s passing, but she said she wouldn’t let me. She stated that I would fulfill my agreement until the end of the year we had agreed upon or else she would share everything with Lauren. I let her know that I was struggling financially and she said that she didn’t care, this is what I had signed up for. I would pay her all of the rest of the money I had promised even if I had to do it in increments until the contract was fulfilled. 
Our financial blackmail dynamic had begun back in January when I moved to Philadelphia and had continued until my mother’s passing in September. After my mom passed, I messaged her and she let me know not to worry about it at all and just take care of myself.
Her boyfriend was blissfully unaware of our arrangement at first, but eventually she felt guilty doing it behind his back and told him about me, and he wasn't too pleased about it. When I found out later that she told him about it, I couldn’t help but imagine his shock and possibly intrigue at the idea that his serious girlfriend was dominating another guy in this fashion at the same time.  
The other girl, Sam, lived in Arizona and stood 5’3” with attractive brown hair and striking green eyes. She was one of the bartenders at Cue Club, the bar where we had my farewell party, where her vibrant personality lit up the room. Sam had a boyfriend, and I suspected he was aware of our arrangement, probably laughing together at my expense behind my back. The thought was oddly tantalizing.
With her sultry, petite frame, she had dabbled in local modeling for the bar and other establishments in the area. Her stomach was as sexy as it was toned, and she had demanded videos of me on my knees, begging her to let me be her little bitch. In drunken, lust-fueled moments, I would plead for her to make me eat dog food. Initially, she resisted, enjoying the build-up of my desperation, but eventually, she conceded and commanded me to fulfill my request.
I took a video myself wearing a dog collar, declaring my submission to her as her little bitch as I took a few reluctant bites of the dog food and sent it over to her. I could only imagine the laughter that ensued between her and her boyfriend as she shared the video with him.  Likely a mix of amusement and disbelief at my embarrassing antics.
Victoria and Sam each brought their own unique style of domination and I found myself paying both of them $75 a week to keep my secret and indulge in the fantasy of being their little bitch boy. Sam was much more reserved whereas Victoria was very direct and authoritative. It was a way for me to satisfy my sexual cravings all within a semi-safe framework that allowed me to explore submission to them without too many risks.
After my mom passed I did make it back for the funeral which was held at a church in my hometown. I was kind of surprised how few people showed up. I was expecting it to be a little fuller of people whose lives she had touched, because she was such a caring and helpful woman especially before the disease took control of her life and happiness.
I had booked a flight for Lauren to visit me after my mom’s passing, desperately seeking the comfort of someone I believed cared for me, regardless of whether our relationship was romantic or platonic. I was genuinely looking forward to her arrival; I needed emotional support more than ever.
However, after one of our nightly phone calls, Lauren texted me that she wasn’t sure if she still wanted to come to Philadelphia. My heart sank, crushed under the weight of this news. In a moment of frustration, I exploded on her. I texted her that if she couldn’t commit to visiting, she might as well stay home and never contact me again. With that, I immediately blocked her number, sealing the door on that chapter of my life.
I must admit, I was a complete momma’s boy. Now that my mom was gone, an immense void had opened up in my life, one that I desperately sought to fill. I realized I needed to find other distractions to occupy my mind. My mom had always been my emotional anchor, and I had been eagerly looking forward to moving back to Phoenix to spend precious time with her again.
Throughout my life, my dad had always seemed bothered by my problems, no matter how trivial they might be, which made my mom my confidant and the person with whom I shared my deepest emotions. With her absence, I felt lost. On top of that, I always harbored deep-seated, deviant submissive desires that had always lurked in the background, kept at bay by my mom’s presence. I didn’t want her to find out her son was a pervert. I felt ashamed of my perversive desires, but I never fully explored them, afraid that she would find out. With her gone, the restraints that had held me back vanished, leaving me to wonder what paths I might now explore.
The girls I had been playing with were fun, but they were amateurs and former friends so even though we’d toy with blackmail and threats of exposure I figured I would be able to talk my way out of it if I ever needed to. Perhaps what I truly craved was the expertise of a professional Financial Dominatrix who could quench my thirst for pure domination.
For years, I had followed the most popular financial dominatrixes online. They always posted videos of their “slaves” completing horrifying, degrading tasks for them. I frequently masturbated imagining I was the slave doing the acts demanded by them in their audacious displays of power over their slaves. 
The hottest of them all was a 23-year-old, 5’3”, 115-pound blonde bombshell named Goddess Jessica. With tan skin, piercing brown eyes, and an enticing smile that suggested she enjoyed the sexual humiliation of her “slaves,” she was a vision of pure temptation. I had orgasmed to her photos and Twitter escapades thousands of times, attracted by the way she manipulated authority over her male subjects.
She was, without a doubt, the most dominant and attractive woman I had ever seen, and I felt an insatiable urge to fully embrace the fantasy of serving her as her slave. With my breakup with Lauren, the relentless stress of my job, and the weight of my mother’s passing pressing down on me, I felt as though I had nothing left to lose. I was ready to dive headfirst into a world of financial submission, yearning for the sexual gratification that would come from being dominated by the hottest, most naturally commanding woman I had ever seen. Little did I know this decision would mark the beginning of a downward spiral into darkness, one that would lead me far deeper than I ever anticipated.
